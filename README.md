documentation

The archive must include a clear README.md (or readme.txt) file with step-by-step instructions, dependencies, expected outputs, and documentation of what each file does. A technically proficient user should be able to reproduce all key figures, tables, and metrics from your report using the provided files. All data collected for ground-truthing (e.g., user annotations, crowd-sourced labels, or survey responses) should be included in the submission. In addition to the ZIP archive, you could optionally create a public GitHub repository. This not only facilitates easier access and version control but also helps showcase your project more broadly, including in your submitted report and presentation video.
