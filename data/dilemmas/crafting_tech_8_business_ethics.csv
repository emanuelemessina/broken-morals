Guido van Drunen is a retired Big-4 partner, an adjunct professor at Santa Clara University, and a Markkula Center Faculty Scholar. Background Claire is a recent graduate majoring in accounting, with a minor in management information systems. She had taken four months off prior to starting her new role with a Big 4 accounting[1] firm so she could complete all parts of the CPA exam prior to commencing work, thinking this would allow her to focus fully on her new job as an audit associate. Claire has chosen to work for a firm where she interned for a summer; she is very much looking forward to getting started. The firm is focused on the audit of technology companies and start-ups, having built up a sizeable portfolio in this area. On her first day, Claire learns that both the partner and the senior manager whom she admired and trusted have both left the firm to pursue other opportunities. As a result, Claire now has a new manager (Fred), and senior manager (Ted), and is working for a newly minted partner (Carol) who was just asked to lead the audit for a new key client, Company Z. The new partner, Carol, was the individual who led the process and submitted the proposal to win the bid as the new auditor for Company Z. There is a lot of excitement and buzz about the new client, and everyone is very keen to get started, both on transitioning the client and the actual audit work. Claire is proud to be part of this team and keen to help the audit team in the best way she can, but she is also a little intimidated by what she feels is pressure to do well. The Dilemma After about two weeks of working on the engagement, it is clear to Claire and the rest of the engagement team that the hours estimated to complete the audit, which were included in the proposal used to win the audit, are not enough to complete the work. To complete the actual work required to render an audit opinion is double the currently budgeted hours, contrary to the proposal used to win the audit engagement.   At the same time, there are a lot of comments being made as to how budgets are not being met and that the team needs to be more efficient and effective. No guidance is provided on how this effectiveness and efficiency is to be achieved, but there seems to be an underlying message that the team should not charge all the hours worked on the job and book some of the time spent on the audit to training and administrative tasks. A week later, Claire is called into Ted’s office and told she is charging too many hours to the job and the work she is completing is taking too long, even for a new associate. Claire later finds out that other associates on the team have had similar discussions and they are all feeling uncomfortable. Many have raised their concerns to Fred, and he says not to worry and to dial back the hours on the time sheets, without explicitly stating that time worked on the client shouldn't be charged. To further complicate matters, the new team members are now receiving emails that they have, as of yet, not all completed their required firm training. This must be completed within 2 weeks, or the partner will be informed, and it could result in disciplinary action. As a result, one of the associates suggests doing training at her house on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, where they can work as a team to get it done so they all stay off any list maintained by the compliance department for not completing the required training on time. All the team members are confused as to whether they should charge this time to training as this is being done on the weekend.

A Business Ethics Case Study  Photo credit: mastrminda/Pixabay Yuvraj Rao '23, a 2022-23 Hackworth Fellow at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics graduated with a marketing major and entrepreneurship minor from Santa Clara University. Introduction IKEA is a Swedish multinational company that was founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad.[1] The company mainly provides simple, affordable home furniture and furnishings, and it pioneered DIY, or do it yourself, furniture. Kamprad originally sold binders, fountain pens, and cigarette lighters, but eventually expanded to furniture in 1948. According to the Journal of International Management, in 1953, Kamprad offered products that came as “a self assembled furniture” for the lowest price, which ultimately became a key part of IKEA’s value proposition going forward. In 1961, IKEA started to contact furniture factories in Poland to order chairs from a factory in Radomsko.[2] Outsourcing to Poland was mainly due to other Swedish furniture stores pressuring Swedish manufacturers to stop selling to IKEA. In the mid 1960’s, IKEA continued its supplier expansion into Norway, largely because IKEA didn’t want to “own their own line of production,”[3] and Germany due to its ideal location (downtown, suburban area) to place an IKEA store. Given IKEA’s suppliers were now not just in Sweden, it led to an increased importance on developing strong relationships with its suppliers. In the following decades, IKEA continued its expansion and solidified its identity as a major retail outlet with parts being manufactured around the world. By the mid 90’s, IKEA was the “world’s largest specialized furniture retailer with their GDP reaching $4.5 billion in August of 1994.”[4] It also worked with 2,300 suppliers in 70 different countries, who supplied 11,200 products and had 24 “trading offices in nineteen countries that monitored production, tested product ideas, negotiated products, and checked quality.”[5] IKEA’s dependence on its suppliers ultimately led to problems in the mid 1990’s. At this time, IKEA was the largest furniture retailer in the world, and had nearly “100 stores in 17 countries.”[6] Also during this time, a Swedish documentary was released that highlighted the use of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan, which impacted IKEA given it had production there. The rug industry in particular is extremely labor intensive and is one of the largest “export earners for India, Pakistan, Nepal and Morocco.” Here, children are forced to work long hours for very little pay (if there is any pay at all). In some cases, their wages are only enough to pay for food and lodging. In cases where children are not paid, the wages are used by the loom owner to pay the parents and agents who brought the children to the factories. Additionally, the work the children must do comes with a lot of risk. More specifically, children face risks of diminishing eyesight and damaged lungs from “the dust and fluff from the wool used in the carpets.”[7] As a result of these working conditions, many of these children are very sick when they grow up. Despite these terrible conditions, it isn’t that simple for families not to send children to work at these factories. A lot of the parents can’t afford food, water, education, or healthcare, so they are often left with no choice but to send their children to work for an additional source of income.[8]  IKEA and Child Labor Accusations The accusations of child labor in the rug industry in Pakistan posed a serious challenge for IKEA and its supply chain management goals. It would need to address the serious issues of alleged injustice for the sake of its reputation and brand image. Additionally, as IKEA also had suppliers in India, it would need to be in compliance with India’s “landmark legislation act against child labor, the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986.”[9] As a result of these accusations, IKEA ultimately ended its contracts with Pakistani rug manufacturers, but the problem of child labor in its supply chain still persisted in other countries that were supplying IKEA. Marianne Barner, the business area manager for rugs for IKEA at the time, stated that the film was a “real eye-opener…I myself had spent a couple of months in India for some supply chain training, but child labor was never mentioned.”[10] She also added that a key issue was that IKEA’s “buyers met suppliers at offices in the cities and rarely visited the actual production sites.”[11] The lack of visits to the actual production sites made it difficult for IKEA to identify the issue of child labor in these countries. To make matters worse, in 1995, a German film “showed pictures of children working at an Indian rug supplier... ‘There was no doubt that they were rugs for IKEA,’ says business area manager for textiles at the time, Göran Ydstrand.”[12] In response to these accusations, Barner and her team went to talk to suppliers in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. They also conducted surprise raids on rug factories and confirmed that there was child labor in these factories. The issue of child labor, along with the accusations of having formaldehyde (a harmful chemical) in IKEA’s best selling BILLY bookcases and the discovery of unsafe working conditions for adults (such as dipping hands in petrol without gloves), led to increased costs and a significantly damaged reputation for the company. It was later discovered that the German film released in 1995 was fake, and the renowned German journalist who was responsible for this film was involved in “several fake reports about different subjects and companies.”[13] IKEA was now left with three options. First, some members of IKEA management wanted to permanently shut down production of their rugs in South Asia. Another option was to do nothing and proceed with its existing practices now that it was announced that the film was fake. The third option was that the company could attempt to tackle the issue of child labor that was clearly evident in its supply chain, regardless of whether the film was fake or not. IKEA ultimately decided to opt for the third option, and its recent discoveries would eventually help guide the policies the company implemented to address these issues, particularly child labor in India. Steps Taken to Address Child Labor in the Supply Chain IKEA took multiple steps to deal with its damaged reputation and issues of child labor in its supply chain. One way in which it did this was through institutional partnerships. One such partnership was with Save the Children, which began in 1994. According to Save the Children’s website, one of the main goals of their partnership is to realize children's “rights to a healthy and secure childhood, which includes a quality education. By listening to and learning from children, we develop long-term projects that empower communities to create a better everyday life for children.”[14] Furthermore, the partnership is intended to “drive sustainable business operations across the entire value chain.”[15] Together, IKEA and Save the Children are focused on addressing the main causes of child labor in India’s cotton-growing areas.[16] Save the Children also advised IKEA to bring in an independent consultant to ensure that suppliers were in compliance with their agreements, which further improved IKEA’s practices in its supply chain. IKEA also partnered with UNICEF to combat child labor in its supply chain. According to the IKEA Foundation, in 2014, IKEA provided UNICEF with six new grants totaling €24.9 million with a focus “on reaching the most marginalized and disadvantaged children living in poor communities and in strengthening UNICEF’s response in emergency and conflict situations.” Additionally, five of the six grants were given to help programs in “Afghanistan, China, India, Pakistan, and Rwanda,” with a “focus on early childhood development, child protection, education, and helping adolescents to improve their lives and strengthen their communities.”[17] Next, IKEA and Save the Children worked together to develop IWAY, which was launched in 2000.[18] IWAY is the IKEA code of conduct for suppliers. According to the IKEA website, “IWAY is the IKEA way of responsibly sourcing products, services, materials and components. It sets clear expectations and ways of working for environmental, social and working conditions, as well as animal welfare, and is mandatory for all suppliers and service providers that work with IKEA.”[19] In addition, IWAY is meant to have an impact in the following four areas: “promoting positive impacts on the environment,” “securing decent and meaningful work for workers,” “respecting children’s rights”, and “improving the welfare of animals in the IKEA value chain.”[20] IWAY is used as a foundation to collaborate with IKEA’s suppliers and sub-contractors to ensure supply chain transparency. As mentioned previously, one of the main goals of IKEA’s partnership with Save the Children was to address child labor in India’s cotton-growing areas. To do this, IKEA and Save the Children developed a program that would ultimately help more than 1,800 villages between 2009 and 2014. More specifically, the program moved nearly 150,000 children out of child labor and into classrooms. Also, as a result of this program, more than 10,000 migrant children “moved back into their home communities.”[21] Last but not least, the program trained almost 2,000 teachers and 1,866 Anganwadi workers (whose duties include teaching students and educating villagers on healthcare[22]) in order to provide each village with a community leader. This was to ensure that the community had a skilled leader to assist in educating the villagers. In 2012, the IKEA Foundation and Save the Children announced that they would expand with new programs in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. This joint program illustrates IKEA’s commitment to improving communities in addition to helping children go to school. Conclusion & Looking Ahead IKEA has taken numerous steps to ensure that suppliers abide by the IWAY Code of Conduct. Companies around the world can learn from the policies IKEA has put in place to ensure that each company has control and complete oversight over their supply chains, which can lead to a more transparent and ethical supply chain. According to The IKEA WAY on Purchasing Products, Materials and Services, one way in which IKEA does this is by requiring all suppliers to share the content of the code to all co-workers and sub-suppliers, thus leading to more accountability among the company's suppliers. IKEA also believes in the importance of long term relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, if for some reason, a supplier is not meeting the standards set forth by the code, IKEA will continue to work with the supplier if the supplier shows a willingness to improve its practices with actionable steps to complete before a specified period of time.[23] Additionally, during the IWAY implementation process, IKEA monitors its suppliers and service providers. To do this, IKEA has a team of auditors who conduct audits (both announced and unannounced) at supplier facilities. The auditors are also in charge of following up on action plans if suppliers are failing to meet the agreed upon standards specified by IWAY. Along with this, “IKEA…has the Compliance and Monitoring Group, an internal independent group that is responsible for independent verification of implementation and compliance activities related to IWAY and Sustainability.”[24] IKEA also has independent third party teams who conduct inspections on behalf of IKEA.[25] By conducting audits and putting together teams to ensure cooperation from suppliers throughout the supply chain, companies can be better equipped to prevent unethical practices in the production of goods and services. In Ximeng Han’s Analysis and Reflection of IKEA’s Supply Chain Management, Han highlights IWAY’s importance in maintaining links with IKEA’s suppliers.[26] Therefore, IWAY plays a crucial role in ensuring supply chain transparency and in building a more ethical and sustainable supply chain. In addition to all of the policies IKEA has put in place to address issues in its supply chain, the company has also donated a lot of money to combat child labor in India. More specifically, according to an IKEA Foundation article written in 2013, “Since 2000, the IKEA Foundation has committed €60 million to help fight child labour in India and Pakistan, aiming to prevent children from working in the cotton, metalware and carpet industries.”[27] Furthermore, in 2009, the company announced that it would donate $48 million to UNICEF to “help poor children in India.”[28] IKEA’s goal to completely eliminate child labor from its supply chain is an ongoing battle, and it is still committed to ensuring that this is ultimately the case. More specifically, it is extremely difficult to completely eliminate child labor from a company’s supply chain because of the various aspects involved. According to a report published in 2018 by the International Labour Organization, these aspects include a legal commitment, building and “extending” social protection systems (including helping people find jobs), “expanding access to free, quality public education,” addressing supply chain issues, and providing more protection for children in general.[29] Furthermore, Han points out the potential downsides that could arise as a result of having a global supply chain like IKEA does. Given IKEA is an international retailer, the company “has to spend a lot of time, money and manpower to enter new markets due to the different cultures, laws and competitive markets in different regions, and there is also a significant risk of zero return.”[30] Han also argues that the COVID-19 pandemic showed IKEA’s and many other companies’ inability to respond to “fluctuations in supply and demand,” primarily due to inflexible supply chains.[31] This information points out the various aspects that need to align in order to completely end the issue of child labor throughout the world, as well as the difficulties of having a global supply chain, which is why child labor is so difficult to completely eliminate. Specific to IKEA’s actions, in 2021, IKEA announced three key focus areas for its action pledge: “Further integrating children’s rights into the existing IKEA due diligence system (by reviewing IWAY from a child rights’ perspective in order to strengthen the code),” “accelerating the work to promote decent work for young workers,” and partnering “up to increase and scale efforts.”[32] IKEA’s fight to end child labor in India highlights the importance of supply chain transparency and putting policies in place that ensures cooperation from suppliers and all parties involved. Additionally, in a Forbes article written in 2021, “According to the data from the OpenText survey…When asked whether purchasing ethically sourced and/or produced products matters, 81 percent of respondents said yes.”[33] Steve Banker, who covers logistics and supply chain management, also adds, “What is interesting is that nearly 20 percent of these survey respondents said that it has only mattered to them within the last year, which indicates that the Covid pandemic, and some of the product shortages we have faced, has made consumers re-evaluate their stance on ethical sourcing.”[34] These results confirm that customers are now considering how a product was sourced in their purchasing decisions, which makes it even more important for IKEA to be transparent about its efforts to eliminate child labor from its supply chain. Furthermore, the company’s open commitment to eliminating child labor and helping communities in India is beneficial in maintaining a positive relationship with its stakeholders. The increase in globalization has made it even more essential for companies to monitor their supply chains and have complete oversight over business practices. IKEA is one of the companies leading the way in building a more ethical and sustainable supply chain, but more companies need to follow suit and implement policies similar to IWAY that holds all parties in the supply chain accountable for their actions. Through supply chain transparency and accountability, companies will likely be better equipped to handle issues that arise throughout their respective supply chains. Furthermore, by implementing new policies, conducting audits, and maintaining close communication with suppliers, companies can work to eliminate child labor in their supply chains and put children where they belong: in school.

Background Bruce is working at a small educational organization that allows incoming college students to take classes to better identify their passions as they transition to college. The organization makes $10 million per year and welcomes 600-700 students annually to take part in a two-month program. No college credit is available for taking these courses, but the program provides a good opportunity for students to try out new subjects. The organization has branches at some of the highest-ranked universities in the United States. When the program is in session at each university, the organization makes arrangements with each respective campus to house both students and workers in the program (many of their workers are also students or recent graduates) in that university’s housing, which is otherwise empty for the summer. The organization was also dealing with a shortage of workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it is struggling to find qualified people to teach in-demand subjects, including a new artificial intelligence class. Given social outings and field trips are a critical component of the overall experience, the organization is hoping to add familiar faces to the staff who connect well with the students. Additionally, revenues are very tight at this time. The company has almost nothing in reserves and they’ve had to lower the price to entice students back into the program. Furthermore, they’re facing additional costs with things like sanitizing all rooms and buying masks. Bruce manages one university’s program in California. The pandemic has begun to subside and the more severe restrictions have been lifted. Fortunately for the organization, student interest is beginning to increase rapidly again. During an interview with a prospective worker, the interviewee, Spencer, tells Bruce that while working, he would need an emotional support animal. This means that Spencer would need to live in a single room as opposed to sharing housing with someone else. Additionally, he would need the dog to accompany him when doing daily work-related tasks. He also requested that the dog be allowed to go on the bus during trips that included the employee and students in the program. Spencer has all documents in order verifying that he is in need of an emotional support dog and has made it clear that his dog significantly helps his overall well-being. Bruce is facing pressure from upper management to hire more people simply to make the program viable, and he sees this is a great opportunity to hire someone who is willing to work hard for the organization. Specifically, Bruce knows that Spencer has a solid relationship with the incoming students and has done excellent work for the university in the past. As a result, he is highly respected on the campus, and is quite knowledgeable about the artificial intelligence industry. However, Bruce knows that Spencer will be difficult to accommodate. There would be additional costs incurred as a result of hiring Spencer, including providing an individual room, additional office space (since some of the staff were allergic to dogs), and separate transportation across campus. There are also additional questions to consider, such as whether it would be right to have the dog around all the time in case students enrolled in the program were allergic to the animal. Bruce is also aware that quite a few people suffer from cynophobia, or fear of dogs, and feels that it would significantly affect these students and staff’s overall experience. Bruce has recently read that “California state law allows people with disabilities to bring emotional support animals or service dogs to the workplace under certain circumstances.”[1] Bruce also knows that most California employers must allow service dogs and emotional support animals to work unless it creates undue hardship.[2] Therefore, Bruce understands that he has some flexibility when it comes to accommodating Spencer’s needs and that if needed, he could take advantage of this ambiguity to benefit the organization. Bruce wants to do the right thing and think through his choice. He is also feeling pressure from management to do something. What should he do - and why?  Questions to Consider:   [1] “California Laws on Service Dogs and Emotional Support Animals in the Workplace.” Law Offices of Mann & Elias.

Background Tre is a recent college graduate who works in the finance and analytics department of a large publicly traded software company. Recently, Tre discovered an alarming discrepancy in the recording of sales which raised concerns about the company’s commitment to truthful reporting to investors.  The software company specializes in providing a B2B database that supplies data to other businesses. A company may want to purchase the database from this software company in order to drive their own business growth, accelerate their sales process, or achieve more ROI. The cost of this product depends on the extent of data provided, so if a business wants to purchase advanced B2B intelligence, this may include data pertinent to department budgets and org charts, technographics, and real-time alerts related to company events. However, a business also may purchase the basic data package, which includes traditional demographic and firmographic details. Advanced functionality products are costlier, and selling more will indicate stronger growth for the software company.  This is Tre’s first job out of college and he’s been working at the company for 10 weeks. He was recently tasked with a new project to develop a visual showing the number of customers who had purchased products, and the dollar amount spent on products with advanced functionality vs. products with basic functionality.  But in his research to prepare the showing he came across a pattern of reporting sales information that disturbed him. He saw, for instance, that a customer’s finance department had  purchased $200,000 worth of “Advanced” products from Tre’s company, and that the same customer’s operations department purchased $300,000 worth of “Basic” products. No problem there: Given the different purposes of each department of the customer’s company, the different purchases made good sense.  But what troubled Tre was how his own company recorded the sales of the two distinct products with different prices. In effect, the entire $500,000 worth of sales were classified as dollars spent on “advanced” functionality products. And then he looked at more instances of how such sales were recorded. And more. Tre realized that every single sale of the advanced and basic versions of the database were listed as sales of the advanced database only. The misrepresentations amounted to millions of dollars. Tre knows that this metric goes to their board of directors every quarter, and it also goes out to investors on their investing call. Institutions who hold stock in this software company may look at this metric while determining the company’s overall performance or potential for growth. Tre feels that the right thing to do would be to speak up and try to fix the way they report this metric. He’s deeply troubled by what appears to be dishonesty, as it conflicts with his personal integrity and moral values. And, as an employee, he grapples with the unsettling realization that investors may be receiving misleading information to make the company’s sales look stronger than they in fact are.  However, he’s aware that he’s new to the company and doesn’t want to ruffle any feathers or create any problems. He also wonders if there’s some good explanation for the way that the sales are recorded. Plus, it’s a stressful time, in which many tech lay-offs are taking place; his own company even has announced that there would be layoffs and, as a new employee, he knows that he may be among the first employees considered for firing. He does not want to do anything to risk losing his job right now because he has student debt to pay off on top of all of the usual and hefty expenses like rent. What should Tre do? Questions to Consider: Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Tre’s decision? It will be important to identify these values on all sides of this dilemma.  For assistance in this matter, please consult “Six Ethical Lenses” from the Framework for Ethical Decision Making by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Examine the organizational culture and the company’s commitment to ethical practices. How does the culture influence employees’ willingness to report potential wrongdoing?

Background Ben is an experienced sales representative at a large multinational information technology company. He’s worked there for years and has developed strong friendships within the company, especially with other sales reps. Ben has been good friends with Michael, another sales rep, since they joined the company around the same time.    Over the last months, Michael shared some personal struggles with Ben, and Ben was doing his best to be a supportive friend. Ben knew that Michael was dealing with some serious financial issues at home and that he was barely making ends meet, trying to support his wife and young kids while also having to financially support his aging parents. Michael let on that he was taking some risky moves at work to come up with some more money and that he was really starting to worry about it. But he never fully disclosed what that entailed.  Unexpectedly, Michael abruptly left the company, leaving Ben shocked and suspicious about the true nature of his colleague’s activities. Ben was assigned to take over Michael’s sales territories and get back on track. During the transition, he discovered the extent of the financial harm that the company suffered as a result of Michael’s actions. Through careful examination of sales transactions and accounting records, it became evident that Michael had engaged in a fraudulent scheme.  Michael had orchestrated a deal with an external company whereby he booked a large number of orders with delayed delivery dates. He received upfront commission payments (meaning he was paid the commission when the sale was made but not when the order was fulfilled) by his own company for nearly one hundred orders, and then split that commission with the external company. In collaboration with the external firm, Michael continuously pushed back the delivery dates every few months, ensuring the orders were never fulfilled. Despite the absence of payment from the external company, the tech company continued paying commission to Michael for these fictitious sales. Essentially, Michael was being compensated for sales that were listed as orders but that were never actually fulfilled (payment for the sale was due on delivery). Reflecting on their past conversations, Ben grew increasingly uneasy, realizing that Michael’s desperate need for quick money through sales commissions had likely driven him to engage in this fraudulent behavior. Ben felt a sense of responsibility and questioned whether he could have prevented the situation, and now, with Michael gone from the company with no repercussions, he wondered what all of this would mean for him. As Ben assumed the responsibility of taking over Michael’s sales territory, the company began an internal investigation to seek any information that could shed light on the issue. This presented Ben with a moral dilemma. During the investigation, Ben was asked if he knew any information that might help the company understand and resolve the issue. Michael’s actions - the deceit, dishonesty, and disregard for responsibility - deeply troubled Ben as they clashed with his own moral compass.  While Ben wanted to uphold his personal integrity as an individual and an employee, and disclose all he knew to the company, he worried that doing so might jeopardize his own position and potentially lead to termination if he were deemed complicit in Michael’s actions. Additionally, Ben empathized with Michael’s difficult circumstances, understanding that he only resorted to fraud out of desperation. A part of him felt inclined to protect his friend and maintain their friendship, despite the wrongdoings committed. Feeling caught between conflicting interests, Ben wondered: should he choose to remain silent and move on as quickly as possible, now that Michael has left the company, and avoid giving any information? After all, exposing the truth could lead to serious consequences for Michael, who was already dealing with significant challenges. It could also cost Ben his friendship. But, even if the fraud was wrong, Ben knew his huge company wouldn’t really feel a big financial hit from the loss and that the product in question was not a life or death matter. Not every wrong can or even should be righted, Ben thought. Moreover, his job and his reputation as a sales rep and his company’s image might all be at stake if he speaks up.  What should Ben do?  Questions to Consider:  Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Ben’s decision?

Background: Ben is a dedicated manager at a prominent multinational company, where he manages teams spread across different countries that ultimately report back to him in California. Ben finds a great deal of fulfillment in his work, particularly when he has the opportunity to travel and visit his team leads around the world. Ben made it a point to immerse himself in the local culture during his business travels, dedicating an extra day or two to learn about the culture before heading into his company’s office or factory in whatever location he was at.  On one trip, Ben traveled to Chennai, India, to visit JP, a lead manager in the local operation. Ben asked JP to spend the day with him exploring the area and its traditions, and JP graciously agreed and took Ben on an eye-opening excursion to a nearby village that, like many in rural India, was poor. Ben noticed JP’s close connections with the villagers. JP, an esteemed member of the Brahmin caste and an elder at the Hindu temple, was highly respected and considered a leader in the community. Ben was grateful for the warm welcome extended to him by the villagers and appreciated the effort JP put into arranging this visit.  But Ben also found himself in an uncomfortable spot.  JP wanted to take Ben to this particular village not only because he knew the people well, but also because a local Chennai clothing company had recently established a business here and he thought Ben would be interested in this new development. The company had adopted a business model that involved renting looms to families in the village, which enabled them to produce cloth materials and fulfill orders from the company. While the families earned money for the piece work, they also had to pay the rent for the looms.  As Ben observed the process, he couldn’t help but notice children as young as ten working at the looms. When visiting one family, Ben and JP met with the parents who told them how this local business was really helping their family. And, as they said that, their two children sat nearby working at the looms.  Ben was cut to the core. He had read about the dangers of child labor and in particular about the way that work on looms can be especially harmful (and how children due to their better eyesight and ability to see subtle distinctions in color are in demand to work on looms). These conditions pose significant risks to children, especially in terms of the potential hazard of diminishing their eyesight and its impact on their overall well-being. It pained him to see these children working while he envisioned his own eight and 11 year-old kids back home (the children in Chennai were about the same age) engaging in such laborious, risky tasks. He would never let his own kids do it. Then again, he thought: I’m not dealing with the circumstances these parents are dealing with.  Ben was aware of how JP spoke very positively about the village and the additional income the children’s labor provided for the families. It was also clear that the children’s parents didn’t object and that the whole village appeared to be on board with this income-producing project.  As Ben’s visit to the village came to an end, some of the villagers, including JP, eagerly asked him to share with them his thoughts on the new business development in the village. Did he approve of it?  What should Ben say? Questions to Consider: Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Ben’s decision? It will be important to identify these values on all sides of this dilemma.  For assistance in this matter, please consult “Six Ethical Lenses” from the Framework for Ethical Decision Making by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. How can Ben navigate this delicate conversation, ensuring his response reflects both his genuine concern for the well-being of the children and his appreciation for the villagers’ hopes and aspirations tied to the new business development? Evaluate the ethical implications of the clothing company’s business model in the village. Should Ben prioritize the economic benefits it provides to families, or should he focus on the potential exploitation of child labor and the associated risks? Explore the concept of cultural relativism and its relevance in this case. Should Ben approach the situation with an understanding and acceptance of cultural practices, or should he advocate for universal ethical standards, such as the prohibition of child labor?   Vari Hall, Santa Clara University500 El Camino RealSanta Clara, CA 95053408-554-5319  About the Center Programs Resources"

Background While volunteering in the Dominican Republic, Dave discovered that the non-profit he had partnered with was exchanging his donor money on the black market, prompting him to navigate a series of complex decisions with significant ethical implications.  At 27 years old, Dave began volunteering with an organization for which he worked in a developing country - the Dominican Republic (DR) - for a couple of years while he earned a stipend. Dave’s project there involved building houses for the poor. He was part of a team that would offer people in poor communities zero interest loans funded with donor money. In turn, the recipients of the funds would build a house (using the funds for labor and construction materials). Then the recipients would owe a mortgage and in turn their payment of the mortgage would go into a revolving fund that allowed the organization to make additional loans and thus build more houses. As part of a United States-based international organization, Dave and his team worked with a non-profit in the DR in order to have local help administering the project. Not only did the local non-profit help with the management and administration of the project, but it also had a bank account in which Dave could exchange his donor money (which was in U.S. dollars) for Dominican pesos that would then allow the recipients of the loans to purchase the labor and building materials locally.  Dave got to know the guys at the non-profit in the DR, and he knew that they were pretty entrepreneurial in figuring out how to attract donor and aid money. After a couple months of working with them, though, he started to feel uncomfortable with the way the currency exchange was being handled.  The DR’s system of capital control required that the exchange of currency go through official banks and exchange windows. Moreover, the exchange rate was set by the government at four pesos per U.S. dollar. It was illegal to buy and sell currencies outside of official banks and windows. But there was nevertheless a thriving black market exchange in which you could get eight pesos per U.S. dollar. From speaking with the non-profit managers through whom he had to go in order to exchange dollars for pesos, Dave became aware that they were in fact selling the dollars on the black market, not on the legal market. It went down like this. He would give them a $30,000 check each month; the non-profit managers would exchange it and give him 120,000 pesos so he could make zero interest loans to help the unhoused. Then the managers would pocket the additional money they made from the higher and illegal exchange rate (another 120,000 pesos that went straight into their pockets).  Dave was genuinely confused. The managers didn’t hide what they were doing. Plus he liked them and knew about their lives and their struggles. He knew they were only making about 8,000 pesos per year and it was barely enough for them and their families to get by. And he wondered what they were doing with all that excess money.  But Dave also knew that if they were getting such a good exchange rate on the black market and pocketing the money, he also could go to the black market in order to raise even more money to help the poor build houses. Why go through the nonprofit and miss out on the chance to help even more of the unhoused?  Then he got an idea.  After some time of working in the DR, Dave got to know a Dominican businessman Alex who was in his mid thirties, married with two kids, and with a middle class lifestyle. Alex owned a sandpaper company and sold his product mostly in the DR. However, he also had one key input for the sandpaper - the adhesive - that had to be imported. And he needed U.S. dollars to buy it.  Because of the high demand for dollars, it was extremely difficult to get them - a difficulty compounded by going through the official government process. Alex had to get in line and wait his turn until a government official checked his request and decided to give him the dollars. But this process could be lengthy and, in the meantime, Alex often had to shut down his factory until he could get the dollars to buy the adhesive essential to production of sandpaper.  So Dave and Alex decided to strike up a deal. Instead of writing his $30,000 monthly check to the non-profit organization, Dave began to write it to Alex instead. In return, Alex gave Dave a duffle bag with 200,000 pesos (which is 80,000 more pesos than Dave would have gotten at the legal exchange rate from the non-profit, but still under the black market exchange rate). Dave was now able to almost double everything for his project and, most importantly, build more houses for unhoused or under-sheltered persons.  Dave was happy to help more people live in decent housing. He thought as well that he was making the most of the funds generously donated to his organization. But he also felt uneasy. He knew the transaction with Alex was illegal and, if either one of them were to be caught, they could go to jail. He was taking a risk himself, but also felt responsible for the risk that Alex was taking. Dave also felt guilty that he took away extra income from his friends at the nonprofit. Finally, he had been reading a lot about development economics and was aware of the way that corruption lowers investment and hinders economic growth. He wasn’t sure if he was part of the solution - or part of the problem.  Should Dave keep up the arrangement with Alex?  Questions to Consider: Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Dave’s decision? It will be important to identify these values on all sides of this dilemma.  For assistance in this matter, please consult the section called the “Six Ethical Lenses” from the Framework for Ethical Decision Making by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. What do you consider to be the most important aspect of this case? Why do you think it holds particular significance in understanding the ethical challenges and dilemmas faced by Dave and the broader implications of his actions? Is it ever acceptable to break the law or engage in unethical behavior for the greater good? Why or why not?  Reflect on your personal values and decision-making processes. How would you approach a similar situation if you were in Dave’s position? What ethical principles would guide your actions and why?

Mauro, Paolo. “Economic Issues No. 6 - Why Worry About Corruption?” International Monetary Fund, Feb. 1997.1 1 According to The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Dominican Republic has faced corruption challenges for almost a century. There have been many efforts to combat corruption in the DR as citizens demand progress, and the U.S. government has also worked with Dominican authorities to address these issues. With a strong interest in economics, Dave was aware of these efforts and knew the consequences of such corruption - it lowers investment and hinders economic growth. Particularly in relation to aid and donations, “many donor countries have focused on issues of good governance, and in cases where governance is judged to be especially poor, some donors have scaled back their assistance” (Mauro 1997). Although Dave intended to support development through his donor-funded housing project, it pained him to realize that he could be actively contributing to the negative consequences of corruption in this developing country.   Vari Hall, Santa Clara University500 El Camino RealSanta Clara, CA 95053408-554-5319  About the Center Programs Resources"

Background As the CFO of a family business, Mary has been put in a difficult position, both by the lasting way the pandemic affected the family business and by family conflict about how to move ahead.  The family business is centered around a revenue-generating building that her grandfather built back in 1910; it is typically rented out as a source of passive income. However, the building is currently not occupied by any tenants, as the pandemic has lowered the demand for office spaces. The building has five shareholders, including Mary, her older brother Donald (who is the president of the family business), her older sister Sally (who is the secretary), and her two cousins. The building is valued at 10 million dollars, and the shareholders have complete ownership of the business, with no debt to pay off. Although all shareholders are minority stakeholders, Mary’s brother has the highest percentage of ownership, equal to 26%. Mary and Sally own just over 25%, and the two cousins, together, own about 23%.  Recently, Donald has said that he wants to be done with the complexities and legalities of the business, and has asked to be bought out. His expectation is to be paid the full percentage of ownership times the fair market value for his share, putting his expectation at over 2.5 million dollars, since, he argues, “family” wouldn’t give anyone less than their full share.  However, Mary knows that that’s just not the way that the business marketplace works. It is a well enshrined principle that a minority shareholding cannot expect to receive a buyout amounting to a proportionate valuation of the entire issued share capital (shares gain in value to the extent they also reflect voting power within a company; a minority shareholder has less voting power and thus less valuable shares). When you have a minority interest in a business, you’re going to be bought out at a discount, and it is not unusual for that discount to be up to 30%. Donald will not accept such a discount and remains firm in his belief that as a family member, he should be bought out in full.  Since no one is likely to buy out Donald’s share in the business, Mary and others agree that the only way to satisfy her brother’s wishes is to sell the building. Donald believes that this is the best option, as their children have no interest in continuing the family business. Mary’s two children, Sally’s three, and Donald’s two are all self-sufficient. Donald argues that they should just rip the bandaid off and sell the building to avoid passing on the responsibilities and burdens of the business to their children.  However, Mary recognizes that selling the building has significant tax implications. After taking inflation into account, Mary believes that they would be lucky to sell the building for 4 million dollars. After splitting the proceeds by her 25% share, she would receive one million dollars, which would be subject to state and federal taxes, ultimately reducing the amount of money she gets to keep to $500,000. Given the tremendous tax burden, Mary believes that selling the business would not be worth it for anyone involved.   Mary reminisces about how she utilized the solid monthly income generated by the building’s tenants a few years ago to support her children and send them to college. She is reluctant to give up the business and lose a substantial amount towards taxes, simply because the building has no current tenants. Mary also believes that hiring people to manage the business is a viable solution.  However, Mary is aware that her brother does not share the same viewpoint and is reluctant to use his own savings to hire external individuals to run the business. He deems it too risky and not worthwhile, particularly since all their children are well-employed and uninterested in handling the business any further.  Due to the significant difference in opinion regarding the fate of the building, it may ultimately come down to a vote. Corporate governance necessitates regular board meetings with all shareholders on the board. Therefore, Donald would need to convince their sister Sally to support him in voting to sell the building and thus in effect liquidate the corporation so that they could have a majority of about 51%.  If it comes down to a vote, Mary fears that personal animosity may harm her relationship with her family members. She ultimately must decide whether to put her financial interests first, or her relationship with Donald. How should Mary proceed, and what are the ethical considerations that should guide Mary’s decision-making process? Questions to Consider Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Mary’s decision? It will be important to identify these values on all sides of this dilemma. For assistance, please consult the section, “Six Ethical Lenses” from the Framework for Ethical Decision Making by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Is it essential to separate personal emotions from business decisions? Consider the virtues of fidelity, self-care, justice, and prudence, and how they relate to the difficult decision Mary must make as CFO. What virtues should Mary prioritize, and why? In considering the potential sale of the family business, how should the shareholders balance their sense of justice towards Donald's expectations for a full buyout with the prudence of recognizing market realities and the tax implications of a sale? What virtues should guide their decisions?   Vari Hall, Santa Clara University500 El Camino RealSanta Clara, CA 95053408-554-5319  About the Center Programs Resources"

Background Adam is a young employee at an after-school learning institution that offers various educational services, including both group and private learning. As a senior leader, Adam is responsible for overseeing personnel and resources, directly reporting to the institution’s owners.  Duing a meeting with parents whose child, Judith, is enrolled in group learning, Adam engages in a discussion about the child’s progress and individualized needs. The parents express their desire to have Hannah, a highly regarded instructor, teach their child. Adam informs them that the group learning service provides a limited scope of services compared to private learning, and if they would like to request a particular instructor they would need to pay more for the private learning service. Otherwise, in group learning, the instructors are assigned on a randomized basis. Sensing the parents’ financial constraints, Adam empathizes with their situation (drawing on his own experience of growing up in poverty).   Towards the end of the meeting, one of Judith’s parents, who happens to work at a prominent musical venue, offers Adam tickets to a highly sought-after event as a token of appreciation for his exceptional work. Although uncertain about the parents’ intentions, Adam suspects that the gift is an attempt to influence him to allocate additional resources to Judith within group learning and thus also as a way to get the benefits of private learning without paying the higher cost for private learning. The parents say to Adam, “We really appreciate all the work you’ve done here and you’ve been doing such a great job, so we wanted to offer you these tickets. They’re in a great location and are extremely hard to come by, and you deserve it.”  Adding to the complexity of the situation, Adam is aware of the cultural aspect involved. The parents come from a culture where accepting a gift is considered a sign of respect, and even if the gift is a means of exerting some influence, it is still a representation of their gratitude. Adam realizes that declining the gift may strain his relationship with the parents and potentially hinder their trust in him and the institution.  Adam finds himself facing a delicate balancing act. On one hand, he empathizes with the parents’ financial constraints and their strong desire for the best educational opportunities for their child. He understands the cultural significance of the gift and the importance of maintaining parental satisfaction - after all, the business runs as long as the parents are happy and the students are happy. He also knows that no one would ever need to know if he were to assign Hannah to Judith thus skipping the randomization process and without Judith’s parents paying for the private package. On the other hand, he felt obliged to adhere to the institution’s policies and principles of fairness, ensuring that every child has an equal chance to benefit from the group learning program. Adam understands that treating everyone equally, unless there’s a sufficient reason to treat someone differently, is fundamental to the institution’s policy of randomization. It promotes fairness and ensures that all students have an equal chance to benefit from the available resources and instructors. Deviating from this policy could undermine the trust of other parents and potentially compromise the quality of the group learning program. He must find a way to navigate this delicate situation, honoring cultural norms and maintaining fairness while upholding the best interests of all stakeholders.  What should Adam do? Should he accept the offer of the tickets? Should he take special steps to assist Judith that go beyond the institution’s policies?  Questions to Consider Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Adam’s decision?

Background Tim worked as the senior vice president for a Fortune 500 savings and loan company, in Dallas, Texas.1 At 29 years old, he was tasked with the crucial responsibility of representing the buyer of a multi-million dollar loan purchase deal involving ten loans worth $130 million.  This deal held tremendous significance for Tim, not just because of the exorbitant sum of money involved, but also because the success or failure of the deal would directly impact his reputation and career. If he succeeded, he would receive all the glory, a substantial bonus, and earn respect within the public company. However, if he failed, he would be held accountable for the loss, damaging his reputation and potentially jeopardizing his future prospects. Moreover, the implications of this deal were enormous, and it would garner significant attention in the media, making Tim’s performance all the more critical.  Sam, who was about 60 years old, was Tim’s counterpart for the deal and represented the seller. After weeks of collaboration on the transaction, Sam called Tim to his office for final discussions before closing the deal. However, when Tim arrived, Sam revealed a new agreement that Tim hadn’t seen before. Tim soon recognized it as an altered “agreement of purchase” required by federal regulators for deals of this magnitude, and Sam pressed him to sign it for “regulatory reasons.” To Tim’s shock, Sam also slid an envelope filled with $85,000 in cash across the desk.  Tim, who was struggling with a significant amount of student loan debt, saw an opportunity to alleviate his financial burdens and provide for his wife and young children. However, accepting the cash was accompanied by significant risks, not only to himself but also to others involved in the deal. It didn’t feel right either.  To make matters worse, Tim didn’t have a great relationship with his boss, and his job was at risk if the deal fell through. The pressure to succeed and provide for his family was overwhelming, and the temptation of the bribe made his decision even more difficult.  Tim knew that whatever transpired would remain confidential between him and Sam. Accepting the bribe could potentially ensure a seamless transaction, eliminating the risks of jeopardizing the deal or facing repercussions from his boss, and it would go a long way in addressing his financial struggles.  How should Tim navigate this dilemma?  1This is a version of a real case that occurred in the 1980s.

In order for students to debate the appropriateness of the decision and response, we will provide an overview of the e-Trading industry Robinhood is a part of and their role within it, in addition to providing a background on the video game retailer, GameStop. Furthermore, the social media company, Reddit, which provided the platform for users to connect and rally behind GameStop and purchase shares, will also be explained and examined. 2.  e-Trading Software Developers Industry The e-Trading Software Developers industry is an industry that allows institutional and retail investors to trade securities online and access and track stock performance. This is a $10.4 billion dollar industry with a 34% profit margin and 325 operators. Within the industry, revenue is expected to increase 3.5% over the next five years, due to increased demand. The projected growth of this industry is based, in part, on the rise of exchange traded funds and index investment vehicles, which are making it easier for people to get general investment exposure. Another growth factor is due to people’s preference for online services that, in the past, used to only be conducted offline. Additionally, trading costs and fees have decreased due to advancements in industry software, increased data storage, and reductions or eliminations of commissions (IBISWorld). The largest companies in this industry are Charles Schwab Corporation with 23.7% of the market and $3.8 trillion assets under management, Fidelity National Information Services Inc. with 19.7% of the market and $2.5 trillion assets under management, and TD Ameritrade, recently acquired by Schwab, with 12.5% of the market and $1.3 trillion assets under management (IBISWorld and TopRatedFirms). The average account size for Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade are $240,000, $112,000, and $110,000, respectively. While the top four industry players account for around 60% of the revenue, the 20 companies in the middle share 10% of revenue, and the bottom 300 companies share 30% of the revenue, making the industry somewhat fragmented with a medium barrier to entry (IBISWorld). Thus, newer and smaller companies hold a small fraction of the industry market share but are fast growing with effective marketing strategies. 3.  History of Robinhood Robinhood is an American app-based stock brokerage company that offers commission free stock and ETF trading (FastCompany). According to their website, “Robinhood’s mission is to democratize finance for all” (Robinhood). It was founded in 2013 and the app was launched in 2015 by two former Stanford University roommates, with the hopes of “democratizing” the financial markets, which were not charging fees to the big investment banks but were charging fees to everyday investors (thestreet.com). Robinhood has a subscription based service that allows members to use instant deposits to trade before the market has opened and after it has closed (FastCompany). Robinhood has $20 billion assets under management with an average account size of $3,500 (BusinessofApps). In 2019, it had 6 million users, up from 3.7 million the previous year (thestreet.com), which is more than the traditional online brokerage of E*Trade. Robinhood’s user base grew to 13 million in May 2020 and is estimated to be near 18 million today  based on an estimate by JMP Securities (NYT and Morningstar). In 2018, Bloomberg reported that more than 40% of Robinhood’s revenue came from selling its customers’ orders to high frequency trading firms or “market makers”, which is a controversial practice on Wall Street (Bloomberg). A “market maker” is a company that offers to both buy and sell a stock at different prices, hoping that the difference between the bid price offered for the amount of stock they want to buy will be lower than the price at which they will ultimately sell. Since investors need to liquidate assets for different reasons at different times, a market maker provides brokerages with the opportunity to sell bundles of stock for cash. The market maker takes on risk by purchasing stock without the guarantee of that stock being later sold for a higher price than that at which it was bought. To compete with exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, market makers, such as Citadel Securities, pay for order flows and offer rebates to brokerages, such as Robinhood Securities (Morningstar). Market makers typically offer better prices than exchanges, and Robinhood makes money off of directing trades to market makers. Market makers execute trades for Robinhood, send Robinhood Securities a record of the trade, and then Robinhood works with a clearinghouse, such as National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), to ensure that the stock gets to the buyer and the money gets to the seller. Market makers provide rebates on trades and pay for order flows, which creates a misalignment of the interests of the brokerage firm, such as Robinhood Securities, and its clients (public.com). They are controversial in how they handle the orders received. Since market-makers have access to the trades before they are actually placed, they technically are able to front-run the trades for their own accounts or engage in other unethical trading practices (Appendix B).   (Reddit.com)  Another way that Robinhood makes money is on the interest it charges to “lend” its clients shares to third parties, such as hedge funds, who may want to “short” the stock. Additionally, Robinhood generates revenue by charging interest to the retail investors who utilize margin accounts. When investors sign up for a Robinhood account, they have the option of opening up a margin account, either a “Gold” or “Instant” account, where they agree to allow Robinhood to lend those shares. That margin account allows hedge funds to buy the stock “on credit” or on a loan from Robinhood. It is a line of credit with interest tied to movements in the price of the stock. When an investor believes that a stock price will go down, he/she can borrow the stock from Robinhood and “short” it. If there is a high demand to borrow that stock and short it, the interest on the borrowing of that stock is high. If there is not a lot of demand to borrow a stock and short it, the interest rate is quite low as the risk is lower to the broker (medium.datadriverinvestor.com). Robinhood holds the actual stock for its investors at the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), whose parent company is the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and then lends out that stock to hedge funds and other agents with margin accounts who may want to “short” that stock (Appendix A). As more demand for shorting that stock appears, Robinhood collects more interest on that loan of the stock and is allowed to keep all of the money earned on the loaning of those shares, as long as the agents and funds have the ability to pay that interest and loan back. If the hedge funds continue to lose because the price goes up (and they have shorted it), it threatens their ability to pay Robinhood back for the loan as well. This allows Robinhood to survive financially without collecting commissions like traditional retailers. 4.  History of GameStop GameStop is the world’s largest video game retailer and was founded in 1984 by Harvard business school classmates.  The first store opened in Texas, and this Fortune 500 company currently operates over 7200 stores in 14 countries (5starsaver.com). GameStop shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company generates revenue by selling gaming consoles and physical video games and accessories. In 2011, GameStop achieved $10 billion in revenue. However, just as streaming services resulted in decreased demand for physical DVDs and CDs, video games are now available to download or stream, making physical discs more obsolete. According to Sony, around half of the video games sold by their company in 2020 were digital. As entertainer reporter, Adam Epstein, writes, “GameStop is the Blockbuster of video games—a relic of old consumption habits, barely scraping by in a digital world” (Quartz). Reflecting the new consumer preference for digital games, GameStop’s revenue in 2019 only reached $6.4 billion, and the company laid off hundreds of employees and had plans to close 1,000 stores (Quartz). One year ago on March 23, 2020, GameStop’s stock price closed at $4.22. On January 27, 2021, less than one year later, the stock closed at $347.51 due to an increase in demand for its stock, proving one of the largest increases in an individual stock price in the history of the NYSE (finance.yahoo.com). The surge was due to a group of individual investors who decided to purchase GameStop stock, after determining that the stock was undervalued, followed by significant institutional buying. The platform that the individual investors used to communicate with one another is the social media platform, Reddit. 5.  Reddit and The GameStop Short  Reddit was founded in 2005 to be “the front page of the internet” (mashable.com), where people went to get all of their information, rather than clicking through multiple sites each day. Today, Reddit is the seventh most viewed website in the United States and 18th in the world (mashable.com), providing internet users with up to date news, affinity groups and a place where users can create their own communities. One of the subcommunities in Reddit (called a subreddit) is a group called WallStreetBets, where participants discuss stock and trading options.  This group noticed that hedge funds had taken a large “short” position on GameStop stock (guardian.com). That means these hedge funds bet that the GameStop stock would go down. When investors “short” a stock, they sell a borrowed stock, believing that the price of that share will go down with the hope of buying it back later at a lower price, thus earning money on the sale and buy back of the stock. There is an unlimited risk since the price of the stock can rise infinitely, allowing the short-seller to lose an infinite amount of money.  The price of that stock can increase forever, making the process of short selling incredibly risky. This is different from buying a share of stock, since the price of the stock cannot fall lower than $0, meaning the investor cannot lose more money than he or she already paid to purchase the share. The subreddit group decided to make several posts beginning on January 22, 2021, on Reddit to purchase the GameStop shares, driving up the price some 600% in four days, thus forcing those large Wall Street firms who bet that the stock would go down, to lose billions in its portfolio (guardian.com).  As more demand for GameStop took over the market, the price went soaring to its high of $347.51 on January 27, 2021. Gamestop saw its market capitalization go from $3 billion to $25 billion in a week and 50 million shares of the company changed hands in the span of an hour on Monday, January 25th (nationalreview.com). The Redditors' purchases of GameStop shares alone did not account for the dramatic price increase, however. The consequences of their purchases did. What caused the price to sky-rocket is a long-established practice on Wall Street called a ""short-squeeze."" Hedge funds often use this tactic against each other. Because hedge funds had leveraged themselves out to short GameStop so aggressively with the hope of squeezing out the last of its potential upside, the Redditors realized that all they needed to do was generate enough upward pressure on the stock price by buying up shares to breach a certain threshold where hedge funds began to lose significant amounts of money. Once that threshold was breached and hedge funds were starting to lose millions with every cent the stock rose, these hedge funds were forced to close out their short positions. Since shorting represents the sale of a borrowed share, in order to close out their positions, the hedge funds were forced to buy the GameStop shares at their current market price. The billions of dollars worth of buy orders by hedge funds to close out their positions and prevent further losses is what shot the price of the stock up so dramatically. And because the Redditors had already bought shares to create that pressure on the hedge funds, the value of their shares rose exponentially. 6.  Decision point: January 28th In the early morning hours of January 28, 2021, Robinhood CEO, Vlad Tenev, received a frantic call from the company’s operations team. The call was based on a letter the team had received at 4 a.m. from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC).  Robinhood routinely receives letters from the NSCC each morning at 4 a.m., so receiving the letter was not the cause for alarm. Rather, it was the contents of this particular letter, a request for the company to show that it had $3 billion in cash, that resulted in the call to Tenev. NSCC, like other clearinghouses, ensures that the purchase and sale of stock goes through smoothly for both the buyer and seller. The volume of stock traded through Robinhood spiked so much that the NSCC needed to see more money in Robinhood’s account to make sure that the buy orders would, in fact, clear. Because of the volatility of stocks like GameStop, NSCC determined that Robinhood needed to have more capital in order to cover a potential collapse in stock prices between the purchase date and the clearing date two days later (Appendix A). Because the deposit requirement of the clearinghouse well-exceeded Robinhood's on-hand liquid capital, the existing trade orders would not have been able to settle unless they satisfied the deposit requirement. Tenev ultimately decided that day to halt buy orders of GameStop stock and negotiate the deposit requirement down to $700 million. Did Tenev make the right choice? Did he have a choice? How is Robinhood going to make this right?   Bibliography Adamczyk, Alicia. ""'You Will Lose Your Money Very, Very Quickly': What Investors Need to Know about GameStop's Stock Surge."" CNBC.

March 29, 2021. https://www.digitaltrends.com/web/what-is-reddit/.   Appendix A: How NSCC Works It takes settlement time on trades (up to 2 days), so that is why the NSCC requires brokerages to increase their collateral when there is high volatility in trading. It allows the NSCC to make sure that the brokerage firms have the assets to back up the potential losses on the trades. For the sake of simplification, let’s walk through a hypothetical. If I were to sign up to some brokerage app like Robinhood, I could buy and sell securities available on the public market. These include stocks like GME or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some brokers also now allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies, though there may be restrictions in trading or transferring these to off-platform wallets. Here’s what this hypothetical process might look like (coindesk.com): 1) I would buy a share of a stock, let’s call it $STOCK, on this app. 2) The order would go to the app’s internal order management system (OMS). 3) The OMS would route the order to an exchange or to another broker-dealer. 4) After the order is matched, the exchange would tell the app. 5) All of the exchange’s orders would go to the continuous net settlement process, which aggregates all of a company’s trades into one long and one short position on the NSCC and this can take up to two days.   Appendix B: SEC Press Release SEC Charges Robinhood Financial With Misleading Customers About Revenue Sources and Failing to Satisfy Duty of Best Execution FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2020-321 Washington D.C., Dec. 17, 2020 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robinhood Financial LLC for repeated misstatements that failed to disclose the firm’s receipt of payments from trading firms for routing customer orders to them, and with failing to satisfy its duty to seek the best reasonably available terms to execute customer orders.  Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges. According to the SEC’s order, between 2015 and late 2018, Robinhood made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications, including in FAQ pages on its website, about its largest revenue source when describing how it made money – namely, payments from trading firms in exchange for Robinhood sending its customer orders to those firms for execution, also known as “payment for order flow.”  As the SEC’s order finds, one of Robinhood’s selling points to customers was that trading was “commission free,” but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices.  Despite this, according to the SEC’s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution quality matched or beat that of its competitors.  The order finds that Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.  Robinhood made these false and misleading statements during the time in which it was growing rapidly. “Robinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,” said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “Brokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.” “Robinhood failed to seek to obtain the best reasonably available terms when executing customers’ orders, causing customers to lose tens of millions of dollars,” said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit.  “Today’s action sends a clear message that the Commission will not allow brokers to ignore their obligations to customers.” “There are many new companies seeking to harness the power of technology to provide alternative ways for people to invest their money,” added Erin E. Schneider, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.  “But innovation does not negate responsibility under the federal securities laws.” Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Robinhood agreed to a cease-and-desist order prohibiting it from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, censuring it, and requiring it to pay a $65 million civil penalty.  Robinhood also agreed to retain an independent consultant to review its policies and procedures relating to customer communications, payment for order flow, and best execution of customer orders, and to ensure that Robinhood is effectively following those policies and procedures. The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Warner and Ainsley Kerr of the Market Abuse Unit and Matthew Meyerhofer, Victor Hong, and Andrew Hefty of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The case was supervised by Steven Buchholz and Mr. Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit and Monique C. Winkler of the San Francisco Regional Office.  Examinations of Robinhood conducted by Michael Marren, Catherine Cotey, Michael Wells, David Kinsella, and John Broderson of the SEC’s Chicago Regional Office and Jerry Schoenborn, Shanti Radkar, Marcus Chan, and Stephanie Wilson of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office contributed to the investigation.  The SEC also acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.   Teacher’s Note Learning Outcomes: This case hopes to highlight the power of social media in influencing actions with the purchase and sale of stock. It is largely a new field as E-trading software is gaining popularity. This is allowing individual investors to participate in trading in a way that was usually reserved for the big investment banks. Social media is influencing the actions of these individual investors, creating a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the markets, with respect to certain stocks. This case also hopes to show that there are investors who are betting against companies, and this “shorting” of a stock allows there to be another market where investors are betting on the direction of the stock price. This can be risky if a person “shorts” a stock because the stock can go up forever, causing excessive losses. The fact that there are investors betting on both possible directions of the stock (short and up), allows there to be liquidity in the market and strengthens the market if there is a stock price that is overinflated. This case hopes to highlight how conflicts of interest may put companies in a position where they have to act in a way that goes against their stated culture.  Robinhood was founded to “democratize” the stock market, but when it halted trading, it went against its stated purpose and did not allow its individual investors to purchase shares of Gamestop stock.  It is complex and nuanced, but we hope that students can see that short-term financial survival can influence people to make a decision that will potentially compromise their mission or purpose. It is important to have these discussions early on as evidence shows that “scripting” or anticipating difficult situations can be a powerful tool to combat this tension and keep companies from compromising their values. Finally, this case hopes to spark a class discussion about whether a company should try to make amends for decisions made that may go against the best interest of its customers.  If so, what are some possible suggestions to make those amends? There are several stakeholders involved with business decisions and what responsibility does a company have to its customers when their own financial survival is at risk?  How can they repair that relationship? Is that even possible?  These are some questions we hope that the case will raise in class discussions. Application: This case is most appropriate for courses in business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and introduction to management. Key Words: Ethics, corporate social responsibility, company values Suggested Uses: This case would be valuable for business ethics classes to show how financial survival and/or short-term thinking can get in the way of values and mission.  It could also be used in a finance ethics class, to show how the market and individuals can be influenced by outside forces and larger and more powerful players in the market, which could lead to a discussion whether that should be so.

https://www.scu.edu/leadership-ethics/resources/the-ceo-of-starbucks-and-the-practice-of-ethical-leadership/,The CEO of Starbucks and the Practice of Ethical Leadership - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"The CEO of Starbucks and the Practice of Ethical Leadership Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Background One year after becoming CEO of Starbucks, Kevin Johnson faced a leadership test when two black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks.  The men were waiting to meet a business associate, but they didn’t purchase anything while they were waiting. The store manager asked them to leave, and they refused, explaining that they were there to meet someone. The manager called the police because the men refused to leave, and the police arrested them. Another patron at Starbucks recorded the arrest on her cell phone, and it quickly went viral. In an interview after the arrest, the woman who took the video mentions that she had been sitting there for a while, and she wasn’t asked to leave even though she didn’t order anything.  Additionally, the video shows the business associate of the black men show up during the arrest, and he asks the manager and the police what the men had done wrong. The general public and those who witnessed the arrest labeled it as discriminatory and racist. This happened on a Thursday and the following Monday, Johnson said that the manager no longer worked at the store.  The arrests led to protests and sit ins at the Philadelphia Starbucks the days following the event. In his apology statement and follow up video release shortly after the arrests, Johnson said, “The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks Mission and Values.  Creating an environment that is both safe and welcoming for everyone is paramount for every store.  Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome—the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong.”   Before the incident, Starbucks had no companywide policy about asking customers to leave, and the decision was left to the discretion of each store manager. Because of this flexible policy, Starbucks had become a community hub--a place where anyone could sit without being required to spend money. Johnson mentioned this community in his apology when he said Starbucks works to create an environment that is “both safe and welcoming for everyone.” Also in his apology, Johnson outlined the investigation he and the company would undertake. The apology detailed actionable steps Starbucks leadership would follow to learn from the situation, including meeting with community stakeholders to learn what they could have done better.  Johnson took full responsibility for the actions of his employees, and he acknowledged that Starbucks customers were hurt by the arrests. Johnson acknowledged that employees needed more training, including about when to call authorities, and that the company needed to conduct a thorough analysis of the practices that lead to this incident. After issuing his apology, Johnson went to Philadelphia and met with the two men face to face to involve them in dialogue on what Starbucks needed to do differently. The week following the arrests, Starbucks announced it would temporarily close 8,000 stores to conduct unconscious bias training, which they did on May 29, 2018.  A month after the arrests, Starbucks released a new “Use of Third Place Policy,” which states that anyone can use Starbucks and its facilities without making a purchase; it also explains what managers should do if a customer becomes disruptive.  Additionally, the policy says that Starbucks seeks to create “a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome. This policy is intended to help maintain the third place environment in alignment with our mission ‘to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.’” Practice of Ethical Leadership Ann Skeet, senior director of Leadership Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, has created a Practice of Ethical Leadership.  Using this model, we can ask the overall question:  How is Johnson practicing ethical leadership? Additionally, we can consider what we learn about his character through his actions and his impact.   Along with character as a cornerstone for anyone’s practice of ethical leadership, we can look at the five additional ethical leadership practices Skeet identifies as a way to explore whether  Johnson’s actions are enhancing his impact as an ethical leader in his role as Starbucks CEO.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/the-vulnerability-disclosure-debate/,The Vulnerability Disclosure Debate - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"The Vulnerability Disclosure Debate Hands on tablet Introduction The debate over “responsible” disclosure of software vulnerabilities has been a mainstay in the security space. In 2015, new fuel was added to the fire as Google disclosed a Microsoft Windows vulnerability, along with exploit code, two days before the scheduled patch. (Exploit code is the stretch of code that hackers can exploit to hack software.)  And in 2018, the debate came back into the forefront with the infamous Intel Spectre and Meltdown chip problems. The Google-Microsoft conflict highlights the issues that can arise between companies around disclosure.  The Spectre and Meltdown flaws show how vulnerabilities can pit companies against the U.S. government and consumers. Company v. Company Disclosure Debate In 2015, the bug was found by Google’s in-house security research team, which searches for vulnerabilities in Google software, as well as that of other vendors, including Microsoft. Upon finding a vulnerability, Google adheres to a strict 90-day policy:  Vendors are notified of the bug, and a public disclosure is automatically released 90 days after, regardless of whether the bug has been addressed. Microsoft initially asked for an extension beyond the 90 days, which was denied by Google, as was a request to extend the disclosure date to the first “Patch Tuesday” of the month (the second Tuesday of the month, and preferred release date for patches for developers). Microsoft criticized Google in a blog post, accusing the company’s decision of being a “gotcha” opportunity, and at the expense of the users, who were at risk for the two days between the disclosure and the patch release. Microsoft reiterated its support for “Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure,” which calls for security researchers to work closely with developers in ensuring a fix is released before the public disclosure. Google, and supporters of similar disclosure policies, argue that firm disclosure dates prevent developers from sweeping vulnerabilities under the rug, and should strike a balance between the public’s right to know and providing  the developer a chance to fix the problem. Many take an even harder stance and propose that immediate public disclosure is the best policy.  Shortly after this incident, Google released an additional update on three Microsoft vulnerabilities. Discussion Questions Companies v. US Government and the Public Disclosure Debate In 2017 and 2018, there was another high profile case of questionable vulnerability disclosure practices known as the Spectre and Meltdown chip flaws. In January of 2018, Intel revealed that millions of their computer chips were vulnerable to hacking; however, Intel did not go public with this information when they discovered it in June of 2017. Instead, Intel told select vendors about the problem (Huawei, Google, Alibaba, and Lenovo, etc.) while they worked behind the scenes to fix it. In this case, certain companies were working together to address the problem, but in July of 2018, several U.S. Senators pointed out that companies with close Chinese government ties knew about the vulnerability before the U.S. government did, putting national security and consumers’ security at risk.

That is what we do at Mozilla, our singular point of focus.” --From Mozilla’s blog Q and A regarding the resignation of Brendan Eich Brendan Eich was a co-founder of Mozilla, an organization set up as a nonprofit foundation, passionate about its purpose.  Eich’s previous political support for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prior to 2015 defined marriage on the federal level as the union between one man and one woman, was well known by the board and employees prior to his appointment as CEO.  What wasn’t known was how strongly employees and outsiders would react to a perceived disconnect between Eich’s personal values and the values of the company. In spite of posting about his commitment to continuing the organization’s support of the LGBTQ+ community through various policies and benefits and apology for “causing pain,”  the issue did not die down. Eich made his own decision to resign as CEO and declined the board’s offer to take another C-level position in the company. American Apparel “Passion, innovation & ethical practices for the clothing industry. That's American Apparel.”--From American Apparel’s website under “About Us” American Apparel founder Dov Charney has never apologized for using sex to sell clothes.  In fact, it’s been central to his company’s strategy and marketing from Day One. He has also long acknowledged his personal behavior is strange and he is his own worst enemy.   For example, 10 years ago, “Charney gave a now infamous interview with Claudine Ko, a reporter for Jane magazine, during which he masturbated, with her consent, while carrying on a conversation about business. He engaged in oral sex with an employee with Ko nearby, too” (Bloomberg Businessweek, July 9, 2014). Also, in 2006, American Apparel starting asking employees to sign a form indicating that they knew they were coming to work in a sexually charged environment. According to board co-chairmen, in mid 2014, Charney was removed as chairman by the board pending termination following a 30-day notice clause in his contract.  The board first gave him the choice to resign if he gave up voting rights to his 27 percent share of the company. In that scenario, he would have received a four-year, multi-million dollar consulting contract.  Officially removed for violating the company’s sexual harassment policy and misusing company funds, Charney refused to go quietly, which threw the company’s ownership and governance into play. Hedge fund Standard General stepped in with a cash infusion for the company following a loan call by another investment firm after Charney’s ouster. Five of the seven board directors voluntarily agreed to step down, and Standard General agreed to add  three new directors. Charney stayed on as a strategic consultant but was eventually fired as CEO in December 2014. Snapchat “Deletion should be the default.”--Snapchat’s mission statement At the end of May 2014, details of sordid emails from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel’s college days were released to the media. Trouble is, his college years were only four years prior to these emails being released, because, in 2014, he was only 24. The e-mails detailed illegal drug use, underage drinking, and misogynistic behavior, including urinating on one after she passed out following sex, and harassing women who he believed were overweight.  Some found elements of his emails racist as well. Spiegel’s privileged background and lavish lifestyle had always  received plenty of press. After the email release, he began getting more press for his bad behavior than his app.  He apologized immediately following the release of the e-mails saying, “ I’m obviously mortified and embarrassed that my idiotic emails during my fraternity days were made public. I have no excuse. I’m sorry I wrote them at the time and I was a jerk to have written them.  They in no way reflect who I am today or my views towards women.” Spiegel remains CEO and was responsible for taking the company public in 2017.

The memo was leaked to the press, which lead to a public outcry and exacerbated an already tense time for gender diversity in Silicon Valley.  Around the same time as Damore’s firing, a white supremacist protest that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia, heightened an already tense conversation about the complexities of free speech in America.  The overall conflicting views on free speech are split down ideological lines:  Conservatives say they aren’t free to express their views because liberals will accuse them of being politically incorrect, while liberals believe that in an effort towards being more inclusive, people should avoid using language that is potentially offensive to marginalized communities.  The Memo Damore says he was trying to point out that sometimes conservative viewpoints aren’t welcome at Google because of its liberal “echo chamber.”  The memo also says that Google discriminates against certain employees and offers development opportunities “only for people with a certain gender or race,” and that Google has lowered the bar by hiring diverse candidates.  Damore believes that in order to have a truly diverse culture, Google needs to create a safe space for more conservative views.  Damore’s memo also states that one of the central reasons there are fewer women than men in tech is women are biologically different from men.  Damore then references scientifically unfounded gender stereotypes to support this line of reasoning.  Some of the stereotypes he uses include:  women are more neurotic than men; women are less capable of handling stress; and women are better at relationships than men because men are better at “things.”  The Response After the memo was leaked, many criticized the contents, calling Damore and his memo “anti-diversity,” with Google employees and some of the general public saying they were offended by its contents.  Critics said Damore’s memo is exactly the type of discrimination that keeps women out of the tech industry, and some female Google employees expressed discomfort at having to work with Damore.  The day after the memo was leaked, Google’s VP of Diversity and Inclusion, Danielle Brown, issued a statement criticizing the discriminatory content of the memo, saying it did not align with Google’s dedication to creating a truly diverse workforce.  Three days after the public release of the memo, Damore confirmed Google had fired him.  Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, released a statement explaining the decision to fire Damore.  Pichai’s statement points out that some of Damore’s criticisms of Google’s attempts at creating a truly diverse culture are valid, but the memo violated parts of the company’s code of conduct “by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”  Pichai also writes, “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.”  Those who disagree with the firing say it confirms Damore’s main argument:  that Google does have a liberal echo chamber; Google is intolerant to conservative views; and that its diversity efforts have actually backfired and stifled diversity.  Others who disagree point to Damore’s right to free speech.  However, there is some legal ambiguity in this case because companies have the legal right to fire an employee who makes statements that could create a hostile working environment for other employees in a protected class (gender, age, sexual orientation, etc.), particularly in an at-will state like California, where Google is headquartered.  But, in California, an employee cannot be fired for their political views, complicating the legal aspects of this situation even further.  Damore sought out legal counsel after Google fired him, and he is currently deciding whether or not to sue for wrongful termination.  Those who believe Google made the right decision by firing Damore point out that the company has made a very public commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive culture, and to have an openly discriminatory employee breaks that commitment.  Keeping Damore around could also negatively impact morale among employees, create a hostile working environment, and lead to a backslide in culture.  Additionally, Google has a peer review process, whereby employees review one another’s performance.  These reviews directly influence potential raises, bonuses, and promotions, so Damore’s critics question whether he could be trusted to give fair reviews when he has openly discriminated against his female colleagues in the memo.  Discussion Questions  You may find the Center’s Framework for Ethical Decision Making useful in thinking through these questions.

The 2016 election season generated many headlines, some of which are notable for being blatantly false. Fake news ranged from, “the Pope endorsed Donald Trump” all the way to “Hilary Clinton is running a child sex ring out of a pizza shop.”  Did “fake news” influence the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election? While the answer is unclear, one thing is certain. The rise of fake news has reached unprecedented levels and has raised serious concerns about how citizens receive their news and form opinions.  The increase in fake news has several sources. Social media platforms like Facebook gave these stories the same visibility as news publications, such as those from the New York Times or Wall Street Journal. Moreover, these posts often had higher engagement rates (comments and reactions) resulting in them receiving even higher visibility and prevalence in users’ news feeds.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially downplayed the problem, calling it a “pretty crazy idea” that fake news on Facebook influenced the election. Zuckerberg has since begun to address the fake news issue, but warns, “We must proceed very carefully… and must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”  The Society of Professional Journalists has a code of ethics with four principles: seek truth and report it; minimize harm; act independently; and be accountable and transparent. But the transition to online platforms has fundamentally changed journalism. Google and Facebook control 80 percent of ad revenues; the same revenue source that news publishers depend on. Moreover, more than 40 percent of people now get their news from social media networks – making Facebook a de facto middleman in people’s intake of news.  Facebook is taking the problem seriously, albeit with a great deal of caution. They have introduced efforts to help users spot fake news and inject indicators of trust (disputed tags) into their posts in partnership with a few institutions. They have also banned fake news sites from advertising on the network.  Does Facebook have an obligation to address the fake news problem? If so, what should be done about it?

Wells Fargo was the darling of the banking industry, with some of the highest returns on equity in the sector and a soaring stock price. Top management touted the company’s lead in “cross-selling”: the sale of additional products to existing customers. “Eight is great,” as in eight Wells Fargo products for every customer, was CEO John Stumpf’s mantra.  In September 2016, Wells Fargo announced that it was paying $185 million in fines for the creation of over 2 million unauthorized customer accounts.  It soon came to light that the pressure on employees to hit sales quotas was immense: hourly tracking, pressure from supervisors to engage in unethical behavior, and a compensation system based heavily on bonuses.  Wells Fargo also confirmed that it had fired over 5,300 employees over the past few years related to shady sales practices. CEO John Stumpf claimed that the scandal was the result of a few bad apples who did not honor the company’s values and that there were no incentives to commit unethical behavior. The board initially stood behind the CEO but soon after received his resignation and “clawed back” millions of dollars in his compensation.  Further reporting found more troubling information. Many employees had quit under the immense pressure to engage in unethical sales practices, and some were even fired for reporting misconduct through the company’s ethics hotline. Senior leadership was aware of these aggressive sales practices as far back as 2004, with incidents as far back as 2002 identified.  The Board of Directors commissioned an independent investigation that identified cultural, structural, and leadership issues as root causes of the improper sales practices. The report cites: the wayward sales culture and performance management system; the decentralized corporate structure that gave too much autonomy to the division’s leaders; and the unwillingness of leadership to evaluate the sales model, given its longtime success for the company.

During the two weeks before and the two weeks after their break-up announcement,” they explained, users “accepted more than one invitation to an event 40% more than [during] the 60 days before and 60 days after their announcement.” The researchers also noted that “’Healing,’ ‘detox,’ ‘drowning sorrows,’ ‘binge watching’ and ‘suffering’ are just some of the words and phrases that are more pronounced in men’s posts before they mark themselves ‘Single.’ The same types of words and phrases are more pronounced in women’s posts on the actual day of their announcement.” As to what helps people get over a breakup, Facebook researchers wrote that “[g]aining new experiences…  seems to be more therapeutic than buying things.” Under the subhead “What it means for marketers,” the post then asks, “How can brands be a part of the journey to help mend people’s broken hearts?” Suggested answers include “Empathize with them” and “Offer them new experiences.” The post concludes by encouraging potential Facebook advertising clients: “Tracking signals of intent to travel, experience new things or take up a new hobby can help you reach this group with a relevant ad at the right time.” Is it ethical for Facebook to mine its users’ posts for signals that those users are about to go through a break up? Is it ethical for the company to then help its clients target their ads based on this research?  Is what Facebook is doing different from what other companies do? How might Facebook’s actions be perceived through the ethical prisms of utilitarianism, rights, justice, virtue, and the common good?

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/apple-vs-fbi-case-study/,Apple vs. FBI Case Study - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Apple vs. FBI Case Study Apple iPhone Kiichiro Sato/AP Photo In the wake of the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, attention turned to the perpetrator’s iPhone.  A federal judge asked Apple, maker of the iPhone, to provide “reasonable technical assistance” to the FBI in accessing the information on the phone with that hope of discovering additional threats to national security. Apple provided the FBI with data it had in their possession and sent Apple engineers to advise the FBI, but refused to comply with the court order to bypass the phone’s security measures: specifically the 4-digit login code and a feature that erases all data after ten incorrect attempts.  The FBI argued that the bypass could only be used for this phone, this one time.  The agency also cited national security concerns, given the phone may lead to better understanding the attack and preventing further incidents. Apple CEO Tim Cook issued a public letter reiterating Apple’s refusal to cooperate.  Cook advocated for the benefits of encryption in society to keep personal information safe.  He stated that creating the backdoor entry into the iPhone would be akin to creating a master key capable of accessing the tens of millions of iPhones in the U.S. alone.  Cook also had concerns that the FBI was outstepping its bounds - by using the court system to expand its authority - and believed the case should be settled after public debate and legislative action through Congress instead. Public opinion polls on the issue were split.  A number of major tech firms filed amicus briefs in support of Apple.  The White House and Bill Gates stood behind the FBI.  In anticlimactic fashion, the FBI withdrew its request a day before the hearing, claiming it no longer needed Apple’s help to assess the phone.  It is speculated that an Israeli tech firm, Cellebrite, helped the FBI gain assess.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/raiding-customer-assets-at-mf-global/,Raiding Customer Assets at MF Global - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Raiding Customer Assets at MF Global Who Was Responsible? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently filed a complaint against Jon Corzine, CEO of MF Global, charging him with directing one of his mid-level managers, Edith O'Brien, to transfer millions of dollars of customer assets to cover a bank overdraft that threatened to sink the firm. If he did so, the former head of Goldman Sachs, U.S. Senator, and governor of New Jersey broke the law. However, Corzine's lawyer claims his client is not guilty as charged because ""it never dawned on"" him that when he, the boss, approached his subordinate with a subtle request to ""find"" $175 million that that call would cause her to ""violate the golden rule"" of protecting customer assets. Corzine faced a dilemma: his bold efforts to transform MF Global—""a plain vanilla commodities firm""—into a full-blown investment bank a la Goldman, would collapse if it didn't quickly deal with overdrawn accounts at JPMorgan Chase, the firm's principle bank, which was threatening to stop doing business with MF Global. Moreover, Corzine's lawyer says that Corzine ""never directed Ms. O'Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose."" O'Brien, a life-long middle manager, does not dispute the fact that Corzine never explicitly ordered her to take the funds from customer accounts. She seems to admit that she knew what she was doing was wrong, but she had no choice because customer accounts were ""the only place where we had the $175 million"" needed to cover the overdraft. MF Global has subsequently declared bankruptcy. Questions: Did Corzine act appropriately? How would you characterize his behavior legally, ethically, and managerially? What other choices did he have?Did Ms. O'Brien behave appropriately? Realistically, what other choices did she have?Should the actions of either Corzine or O'Brien (or both or neither) be considered criminally negligent? Unethical? Bad judgment?

On her first day of work, she was shown around a laboratory where she would complete most of her projects. During this time, she was also introduced to nine male interns who would be sharing the same lab space. Since the lab could only accommodate five interns at a time, a vote was held to determine who would work in the lab during the day (e.g. 8am to 4pm) and who would work at night (e.g. 4pm to 12am) during certain days of the week. The morning shift was a popular option for a majority of the interns; Ramona was fortunate to be selected for four (out of five) morning shifts. Weeks passed. Ramona had been enjoying her work and almost completed one of her projects. However, one day, a fellow intern asked how she was doing. Ramona commented that she was “good but tired.” The intern replied that Ramona had “no reason to be tired because [she was] working mostly day shifts.” Ramona was offended, but chose to ignore his comment. The next day, she ran into several interns, one of whom was the one she encountered the previous day. At some point in group’s conversation, the same intern made a remark about how Ramona “always got her way [in the workplace] because she was a girl.” Ramona was upset; however, because she did not want to cause a scene, chose again to ignore his remark. During the following weeks, Ramona tried to avoid the intern who made the inappropriate comments. However, certain settings forced her to interact with him and, in those times, he made a point to make Ramona feel guilty and trivial.

He wanted to give his customer more details if it was for the benefit of his client’s final product, but, at the same time, was concerned because the requested information was protected under his company’s non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Dylan decided to discuss the matter with his supervisor; however, Dylan’s manager was overseeing many projects and, knowing that Dylan was capable and experienced, entrusted him to take care of the situation. When he returned to work the next day, Dylan received an email from his customer. The message stated that, if the chip’s manufacturing methodology was not disclosed, the customer would cease further investments in the product. Shocked, Dylan believed that if the customer could not abide by the NDA, he should tell the contract should be broken off. However, doing so would mean losing a significant amount of profit they had intended on garnering from selling the chip. On the other hand, sharing confidential information with his customer could cause negative repercussions, especially if his company were to discover the legal breach. Although it is highly unlikely that the extra chip information would be used by Dylan’s client for malicious purposes, its disclosure could potentially affect his company’s reputation, lead to mistrust in the company and compromise Dylan’s position. What should Dylan do? Jocelyn Tan was a 2014-2015 Hackworth Fellow in Engineering Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.

His department has been developing a new medical device to detect HIV faster and cheaper, and the facility has promised investors a prototype would be ready in a year. However, the preliminary results have been somewhat disappointing as only 60% of the case samples have tested positive for HIV, whereas the expected sensitivity was aimed at 80%. Product development had been extended for another six months, but additional funding is needed to continue the project. Concerned about the low true positives detected in HIV cases, senior managers decide to convene with their scientific advisors (who are under non-disclosure agreement) to determine if 60% is sufficient, if the study is adequately powered, and if there is a better way to evaluate the data. Before the meeting, Joaquin’s boss asks him to trim the data by reporting results only from certain samples, and filter out samples with low yields through observations made during meta-analysis of the clinical data. Joaquin is uncomfortable with trimming, and argues with his boss that the scientific advisory board (SAB) should see all of their analyses, unfiltered and filtered, because it’s valuable information that could be telling them something about disease stage or test performance. His boss states that as long as they don’t lie about the numbers, there’s no harm in filtering. Joaquin counters they should show a flowchart of the numbers they started with, clinical metadata groupings, analysis methods and filtering steps so that all the information is laid out openly. In this way, the SAB has the opportunity to ask about the methods used to achieve their receiver operating curves, and better understand the clinical cohort subclassification applied to the analysis. The more they argue over the discussion, the more his boss is unwilling to relent. Joaquin knows that the scientific advisors will expect to see sensitivity and specificity data, ROC curves, false positives and false negatives, and figures of all unfiltered data. While the device is on its way of determining positive HIV results, it is not there yet, so he understands his boss’s reluctance to share the information. How should Joaquin and his boss address this problem? Nabilah Deen was a 2014-2015 Hackworth Fellow in Engineering Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.

Each of these systems costs approximately one million dollars and Avery’s sales goals are to sell at least ten of these systems per revenue quarter. These sales expectations are in place because Avery’s company is trying to go public (IPO). In order to do so, they must be profitable for five quarters in a row. Therefore, there is enormous pressure from the company’s investors and board to meet the assigned sales goals. As the end of the fifth quarter approaches, Avery realizes she is one sale short of reaching her goal. When she approaches her manager to let him know that she will not be meeting her goals, he explains to her a way to get around the problem. He tells her that when he was a sales engineer, he would approach customers who he knew would soon be purchasing a system. He would get the customer to place the order and receive a price discount if they come to the factory, be shown an empty shell of a system that was not yet built, and sign paperwork documenting their acceptance of the unbuilt system as if it was already built. That way the order could count as part of this quarter’s profits, but the customer would not have to pay for the order until the next quarter. Avery’s manager explains that although this practice of falsifying sales reports is now illegal, when he was a salesperson the practice was a common way of meeting sales goals. Additionally, he suggests to Avery that he would look the other way if she were to falsify a customer acceptance report and reminds her that the company will only be able to go public if she meets her sales goal. If she fails to meet her goal, the IPO will be postponed at least a year and so will her IPO profits and the profits of all the other employees and shareholders. What should Avery do?

Some of the projects are pretty straightforward in their mission and material requirement, but for one project, Jack isn’t sure whether the company should be funding it. The project’s mission is to provide new solar panels for an East African community but the project data suggests it is more practical to just install better lighting inside the homes. Jack wonders whether to bring up his doubts with his boss. Based on the company’s research on the community, the community desires better lighting system for their homes, and the solar panels would be an expensive and high maintenance project. Not to mention, there was a previous project that (when followed through) resulted in equipment being stolen from the same region to exchange for money. Jack understands their local sponsor would gain a great advantage in featuring solar panels in the community. It would also foster a good business partnership between the two companies. However, Jack feels it is his responsibility to provide the community with a more simple and efficient solution to their problem, without diving into a large project that could possibly lead to negative side effects.

One day, Kara was contacted by a journalist to talk about her experiences at the firm. Kara spoke about how she often encountered cases where companies did not accurately depict levels of solid particle pollution occupying the companies’ respective surroundings. Instead, technical experts, who are mostly engineers, would misrepresent data in order to make it seem that minority parties were responsible for a greater part of the contamination. At the end of the interview, Kara emphasized the necessity of engineers taking ownership and being honest about the presentation of data.

The project had been a success when delivered to the community, but the community member remarked that the filters had broken down a while ago.

In his role, he must work with an international non-profit organization, SolarSolver, to develop a portable solar panel kit for rural villages in Belize. During a visit to the company’s headquarters, one of the organization’s representatives, Shiraine, asked Jeremy about using fellowship’s grant money to purchase items not readily available in Belize for SolarSolver. Since fellowship funds were obtained through a reimbursement process, she wanted Jeremy to falsify receipts from solar-kit related purposes to obtain the money. Jeremy’s first instinct was that it would be unethical to use money intended for one purpose to fulfill another. However, he recalled Shiraine doing him several favors in the past. For instance, prior to his admittance into the fellowship, Jeremy had worked closely with Shiraine and other SolarSolver representatives to develop a proposal for his project. If it were not for her help (as well as her company’s help in sponsoring the project), Jeremy strongly believed that he would not have received the fellowship. Another time, a power outage occurred while he was demonstrating the solar-kit’s operation and installment to local villagers. Jeremy tried calling SolarSolver’s headquarters, but it was already past sundown and nobody was in the office. Finally, he decided to call Shiraine’s house for help. To his relief, Shiraine answered and immediately sent a team with portable light generators to Jeremy’s rescue. Jeremy is grateful for Shiraine’s acts of kindness, but he does not believe that falsifying receipts is the right thing to do. What should Jeremy do?

While on the train home from work, he starts chatting with the man sitting next to him. When Anthony mentions that he is researching regenerative medicine, the man becomes very interested and starts asking a lot of questions. Anthony ends up talking to the man for nearly an hour and explains to him the potential therapies which could be developed from his research. The man then says that he would want to undergo these experimental therapies even if it meant he would only live a couple more years. Anthony then realizes that this man is in a wheelchair (a divider prevented him from seeing this sooner), and that the man is willing to do anything to regain his ability to walk. Anthony explains that his research is many years away from human testing, but the man says he would sign up for any testing, even if it wasn’t safe. As a scientist, what are Anthony’s ethical responsibilities when discussing his research? Does a person so desperate for a cure truly understand the consequences associated with experimental treatments? Is it wrong to provide hope for these individuals, especially considering that many therapies are years away from being used in humans?

During this longitudinal study, results from one of the negative control samples surprises Milo as it changes from being consistently negative to being consistently positive for early stage prostate cancer. As no device has perfect sensitivity and specificity, he initially believes the change is due to is a false positive result or mislabeling during processing, and therefore dismisses it. However, the next sample from the same negative control patient again produces the same positive result.

The startup had an internal policy that mandated customers who purchased over 15 units of a particular LCD display were qualified for a standard 25% volume discount. However, before Dan’s manager left for a business trip, he instructed Dan to give H.Technologies only a 10% discount. A few days before the closeout, Jerry asked Dan why the client would not receive the standard volume discount. Dan explained that the discount had not yet been revealed and H.

The trial is being conducted on a newly developed drug and consists of applying the drug on the subject’s skin and monitoring the effects the drug has. This trial is in the first phase of testing, meaning the goal of the trial to determine if the drug is safe for human use. The drug is applied topically and the rate at which the drug is absorbed into the subject’s skin is monitored. After data had been collected from all the subjects participating in the trial, Willow analyzed the data and found that there was a wide range in the rate at which the drug was absorbed. All subjects were given the same dosage amount, and it was expected that the drug would be absorbed at a slow, constant rate. Some subjects showed this trend, while others absorbed the drug at a high rate, meaning a high concentration of the drug quickly entered their system. This was cause for concern because absorbing the drug at a high rate could lead to serious health consequences for the potential users of the drug. Willow reported her findings to her client, the company which had developed the drug. Her report outlined the wide range in rate at which the drug was absorbed. The client was unsatisfied with the report and asked Willow to re-analyze the data. However, this time they requested a report which contained only the average rate at which the drug is absorbed. Willow knows that a report which only presents the average rate of absorption will not show all the safety concerns shown in the clinical trial data. However, her client ensures her that her report will only be used to show investors that the drug has progressed to clinical trials. Additionally, the company assures her that they are fully aware of the safety concerns associated with the drug and are currently researching methods to fix these problems. What should Willow do?

One thing Jack noted was that the same names reoccurred frequently in several departments. ""It is our tradition,"" commented the HR head. ""Families take care of their own. If one family member gets a good job in a Philippine company, other members of the family apply to join that company and the first member there can help the whole family become successful by helping them get hired and by coaching them to be successful. The company benefits: Our costs of recruiting are lower, we know more about the people we hire, and the commitment to family success results in fewer performance and discipline problems because family members want to please their older relatives.""

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/show-me-the-money/,Show Me the Money - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Show Me the Money Is a Minimum Wage Ethical? Minimum wage has been controversial since it was first proposed to Congress in 1935, as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that was ultimately passed in 1938. Precipitated by the Great Depression, the FLSA banned child labor, set the minimum wage at 25 cents per hour, and limited the work week to 44 hours. The federal minimum wage did prevent worker impoverishment for many years, but inflation has eroded its effect over the past four decades. Debate over minimum wage is never ending. Almost eighty years after passage of the FLSA, politicians, economists, and social justice advocates still argue about whether the U.S. should continue to have a federal minimum wage. Who does it help and who does it hurt? If kept, what is the correct level? Should it apply to all workers? Does raising the current level increase unemployment, drive businesses away, or hurt the very poor it is aimed at helping? Or, will a higher minimum wage raise the standard of living and increase buying power for low wage earners? In 1963, Martin Luther King fought to get the wage raised to $2 per hour so that every worker could escape poverty. That wage would translate to $15 today when adjusted for inflation; however, today's (4 September 2014) federal minimum hourly wage is set at $7.25 per hour, yielding an annual income of $15,800. With economic ups and downs, and with each change of administration, the question of raising the minimum wage comes up. Indeed, the question of whether the U.S. should have a minimum wage at all resurfaces. Many states, and even some cities, have established minimum wages higher than the federal level. Some economists and politicians argue that raising the minimum wage does a disservice to those it tries to help. They claim that businesses will resist a higher minimum wage by laying off workers, moving their businesses offshore, or just closing down. Some sympathetic to the plight of the poor claim that society should deal with poverty in a different way, such as through private charities. Most opponents of a minimum wage claim that workers are free to seek better paying jobs or to work harder to become more valuable to their employers. They argue that the market should decide the value of any sort of work to employers, just as it determines the value of those employers' goods and services. They claim that employers simply will not hire workers who are not worth the prevailing minimum wage, thus denying these potential workers an opportunity to start a work career. These critics point to teenagers as a perfect example of potential workers whom employers may feel are simply not worth the set wage. Economists, politicians and others who favor raising the minimum wage consider failure to do so an exploitation of the poor and a moral wrong. They assert that in a perfect market economy, employers might pay higher wages to get and retain good employees. Since the market is not perfect, employees must be protected by minimum wage to prevent employers from paying artificially low wages that unjustly exploit the poor. Advocates of a decent living minimum wage offer evidence that raising the minimum wage adds more consumers to the economy and does not substantively increase unemployment. Minimum wage advocates point to companies like Costco that demonstrate that paying employees well results in loyal, productive employees.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/bioethics/resources/drug-pushers/,Drug Pushers - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Drug Pushers The Ethics of Pharmaceutical Marketing Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars annually to research, develop, and market drugs. According to the Pew Charitable Trust, the pharmaceutical industry spent over $27 billion on marketing alone in 2012, with $24 billion of that devoted to marketing to physicians. The Economist (3/2/13) reported a Deloitte survey showing that 35 percent of doctors accept food, entertainment, or travel from the pharmaceutical industry, and 16 percent accept consulting or speaking fees. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education reports that pharmaceutical and medical device companies sponsored almost one-third of continuing medical education (CME) opportunities for doctors in 2011. Observers worry about whether physicians can be objective in selecting and prescribing drugs when they are plied with free samples, gifts, speaking and consulting fees, and free CME. PewHealth reports that distribution of a sample drug results in doctors prescribing that specific drug more often. Drug costs for patients who receive a sample are higher because doctors tend to prescribe that drug instead of a less expensive generic once the sample is used up. Further, most samples are given to insured patients, rather than to those in need, as the industry claims. Critics also worry that persuasive and persistent sales representatives (who are not trained in medicine) have highly sophisticated marketing techniques and strong financial motivation to sell their company's drugs. The Pharmedout project of Georgetown University Medical Center reports that 16 percent of doctors change their prescribing practices after one minute with a sales rep and 52 percent change after three minutes. Doctors' insistent denials of being influenced by drug reps are belied by the success of the industry's marketing efforts. Given the complexity and ever-changing nature of medicine, some experts assert that information doctors gain from pharmaceutical companies' efforts is valuable enough to outweigh the documented higher cost to consumers and the possibility of bias in doctors' prescribing habits. A number of health systems, including the Veterans Administration, have prohibited visits by drug reps and financial relationships between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as Obamacare) includes a ""Physician Payment Sunshine"" provision requiring doctors and hospitals to reveal all financial relationships they have with the pharmaceutical industry. Some critics of pharmaceutical marketing tactics believe even stronger limitations should be imposed.

Many of these pre-chosen applicants were friends of current employees. Jenny reported what she witnessed to Matt, the department’s business manager, who was second-in-command to the department head. Matt told her, “You heard nothing, you saw nothing, you say nothing.” Jenny was absolutely shocked; not only by the corruption, but that it was deliberately being swept under the rug.

Many potential clients – from universities and medical centers to private institutions – expressed a strong interest in the company's technology. Knowing that this technology was both powerful and relatively unregulated by the government, both Johnson and the company were keen to monitor who they sold their products to. The company's solution was to investigate potential clients and only sell to those who demonstrated “bona fide use,” i.e. a legitimate use that would be carried out in good faith. However, determining what was and was not bona fide use proved to be tricky. Some researchers wanted to use the technology to investigate the genes of specific ethnic groups in order to understand common genetic diseases within that group. While this particular project was intended to benefit people, the company was concerned about how that information could potentially be used in the future, not to mention the company's culpability for that use given that its technology was used in the research. The company was concerned that the kind of information the potential customer would have access to could be used to discriminate against people with certain genetic markers, particularly by insurance companies looking to increase rates for clients at a higher risk for illness.

Ian's organization is applying to a research foundation that could promise millions of dollars in funding. However, before Ian can apply, the foundation requires a formal evaluation of the group's organizational success, which must be conducted by a third party. The foundation requires one of the following experiments: 1) Randomized control experiment: This type of experiment is the most scientifically valid because it allows the greatest reliability of statistical estimates of treatment effects. In the case of Ian's organization, half of a group of eligible students would be randomly selected to do the college prep program while the other half not do the program but would still be tracked. If Ian selects this method, his group would receive significantly more funding because the method is more ""scientifically valid.” On the other hand, this poses an ethical dilemma because it would involve actively withholding services from half of the eligible students who would otherwise be selected. 2) Quasi experiment: This type of experiment is an observation-based study that measures the causal impact of an intervention on a target population.  It does not require random assignment of students into treatment and control groups.

Working directly with the co-founder, Mike, Ralph was responsible for door-to-door sales, pitching the company's platform that helped clients gain a virtual following of customers. The business owners in the area often spoke English as a second language, making clear communication between the two parties a key concern for Ralph. On one sales call, Ralph approached a small hair salon and secured a contract along with a $100 signup fee. However, the situation soon turned sour, as the hairdresser was furious after learning that she would have to operate the online platform herself, as opposed to the full service deal she thought she had signed. Mike, Ralph's boss, now found himself stuck in tough situation. Ralph claimed that he was blatantly clear what the contract was offering, though mentioned communication was strained due to the language barrier. Under the company's philosophy of putting the customer first, Mike refunded the $100 signup fee and voided the contract. This was not the first time Mike had to refund a contract under these conditions, causing Mike to revisit both the contract and Ralph's sales pitch to ensure that the language was a clear as possible. After this incident, it was clear that adjustments have not made an impact, and the company continued to lose money on negated contracts and time wasted not pursuing interested customers. Mike began to consider redrawing their target areas away from those where English is not the predominantly spoken language, but is concerned that would be an injustice to those potential customers. Should Mike make the decision to work only with English-speaking customers? Is that an ethical solution? Are there any alternatives?

She had interned at the company the year before and was happy to return. Her job was to review, revise, and create documents that outlined key department processes. Megan had worked in the department and reported to the same manager, Cindy, as the previous summer. Cindy was a ""big-picture"" manager, while Megan considered herself more detail-oriented. Despite this difference, Megan and Cindy got along well and had a good working relationship. Towards the end of the summer, Megan was tasked with creating a document that described how the company renews client contracts and obtains quotes for customers. Although parts of the process had been documented elsewhere, Megan had to outline the extensive process in one document because various teams in the company referred to it on a frequent basis. For example, Megan's manager, Cindy, used this particular renewal process document as a training guide for new employees. In order to successfully complete her assignment, Megan spent a significant amount of time communicating with Sarah, a company manager based in Ireland. In fact, Sarah's team managed the renewal process that Megan was working to document, so Sarah was quite familiar with how the process worked. During this phase of the project, Cindy made it clear to Megan that she did not work well with Sarah and did not appreciate her work style. Megan began creating her report, once completed, sent it on to Cindy, Sarah, and other managers for feedback and revisions. Not before long, Megan found herself in the middle of each manager's differing opinion. Cindy felt the document should be written at a “higher level,” and did not want to confuse new trainees with “once in a blue moon” scenarios that could be handled on a case-by-case basis. Sarah, on the other hand, wanted every detail and discrepancy of the process included so her team could use it as a comprehensive reference guide. During the editing process, Cindy would visit Megan's desk, wanting to gossip about her experience working with Sarah and ""how awful the project must be"" for Megan. Megan was conflicted: she wanted to remain on good terms with her manager, Cindy, and it was clear that there was a great deal of tension between her and Sarah. At the same time, she felt that Sarah's opinion was more representative of what the company actually needed from the final document. What should Megan do?

He is part of a team that qualifies sales opportunities. After talking to potential customers, Frank decides whether or not they are quality leads. If they are, he refers them to an account executive (AE) to close the deal, saving the company precious time in money in avoiding low probability contracts. If not, he will not pass them on and the sales opportunity is not pursued. Account executives expect prescreening of potential leads in order to maximize their time. Each referral Frank passes to the AE is added to a tally that counts toward his target monthly total, and there is a monetary bonus for all sales staff members who reach their monthly quota. This creates some controversy among Frank's team members, who are faced with conflicting incentives; pass on low quality leads to hit your quota, or focus on quality and risk missing the monthly target.  The pressure to ""hit your number"" comes from both the monetary incentive and management, who benefit when their sales team hits their quotas. To further complicate matters, since each sales representative self-reports how many leads they passed along, they can inflate their numbers in order to reach the monthly target goal: a common occurrence among Frank's coworkers. As Frank tries to adjust to his new job, he is finding it difficult to balance his own moral compass with the pressure of hitting his monthly number.

He is currently auditing a local company's financial statements, a project he's been working on for about two months. The senior associate responsible for tracking billable hours has been pressuring Scott and other associates to report fewer hours than they actually worked. The senior associate would appear more successful if his team reported fewer hours, and the firm would also be better positioned to win similar contracts in the future. Scott is salaried, so billable hours don't affect his compensation directly. However, he knows that underreporting billable hours is against company policy. In accounting firms, offering low billable hours is attractive to potential customers, as the bid with the lowest overall cost will get the business. At the start of any bid, the client agrees to pay a fee for the company's services, including all staff time. If the employees report fewer hours, the company looks more attractive and will more likely get the contract. Pressure to report fewer billable hours comes from the ""utilization metric"" used to determine how efficiently an employee is working. Employees who report fewer hours than their peers will be seen as more efficient, due to a higher utilization rate. Scott remembers a case where one of his colleagues was promoted, partially because of his extremely high utilization rate. He knows that if he were to clock all of his actual hours worked, he would be at a disadvantage for the year-end performance review.

The intense price cutting has been worrying the cement companies and the KCDA (Kerala Cement Dealers Association) as it negatively affects the market price of cement and also the profit margin of the dealers. This has also resulted in unhealthy competition among the dealers. After many discussions and trials, the KCDA and the cement companies have arrived at a conclusion that they’ll suspend the dealers, for a stipulated period, if they are caught in price cutting. This decision has been able to bring things under control to a certain extent. However, the rule breakers have started finding their way out to beat the system. They do not mind running the risk of a suspension as the punishments currently in place are not stringent enough. Some of the dealers use false proofs with which, the chances of getting caught are bleak. Some of them negotiate with the customers and promise them to give them the cement for a lesser price, provided they keep it a secret. Some of them promise the customers to give huge discounts on other items they buy. Due to many such issues, which are beyond control, the company and the association have not been able to bring in a fool-proof system. This is making the life very difficult for dealers who are ethical. Furthermore, the rule breakers end up making undeserved profits. Hopelessness in finding a fool-proof solution has forced some dealers who are ethical to take up unethical ways. My view As it is difficult to make the system fool-proof and as it is hard to bring proof against the offenders, the KCDA and Cement companies should make the punishments harsh. In the present scenario, if a dealer breaks the price limit and sells a cement brand say ‘xyz’ to a customer, he is suspended from selling only the brand ‘xyz’ for 3-7 days. However, this does not affect him much as he still has the freedom to sell other brands. So, I feel that if a dealer is caught for price breaking, his minimum suspension should be for 2 weeks and he should be suspended from selling all the other brands. Repeated offence should attract punishments as severe as dismissal. Fear of harsh punishments would force many dealers to refrain from indulging in such unethical practices. KCDA and companies should also look at identifying (though it is very difficult) and rewarding those following ethics, since rewards are more influential than punishments (Trevino and Youngblood (1990)).

The company views itself as more than just a photo-storage tool but a way “to experience moments in your friends' lives through pictures as they happen. We imagine a world more connected through photos.” In April 2012, the 13-employee company was acquired by social networking giant Facebook for approximately $1 billion. In less than three years, Instagram has become one of the fastest growing social media platforms as seen by its estimated 12 million daily users.1 Dilemma In December 2012, several months after being acquired by Facebook, Instagram announced new changes to its privacy policy and terms of use. According to the updated terms, ""a business or other entity may pay Instagram to display users' photos and other details in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you,"" and there was no apparent option to opt out.2 The backlash was immediate. Photographers and celebrities were particularly upset, given that their photos were a part of their own businesses and brand images. Instagram was quick to respond that its intention was simply to improve advertising. Co-founder Kevin Systrom posted, “Our intention in updating the terms was to communicate that we’d like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram. Instead it was interpreted by many that we were going to sell your photos to others without any compensation. This is not true and it is our mistake that this language is confusing. To be clear: it is not our intention to sell your photos.”3 Instagram's privacy policies and terms of use were once again updated in January 2013. The current terms state, “You hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post.”4 Instagram also reserves the right to share users information (including analytics information, log files, cookies, and location data, as well as the content users post) with companies affiliated with Instagram (mainly Facebook), third-party service providers, third-party advertisers, and “other parties.”5 While the initial backlash against Instagram has been quelled, there is still uneasiness among users regarding privacy issues. Instagram has to walk a fine line to keep its users happy and still turn a profit. On one hand, Instagram offers a free service to users, which up until this point has been free of advertisements, unlike other social media platforms like Facebook. In order to remain a viable company, Instagram has to bring in revenue somehow, and advertising seems the obvious choice. Our Response We believe that it is not unreasonable for Instagram to try to make money using member photos for several reasons. Firstly, it would be foolish for Instagram to walk away from such a lucrative revenue opportunity. On January 17, 2013, it announced the following powerful statistics6 : With staggering numbers such as these, how could a zero-revenue company not optimize these opportunities? And let us not forget that Facebook purchased the company for $1 billion in cash and equity in April 2012. Facebook owes it to its shareholders to try to monetize Instagram considering how much it spent on this company in addition to Facebook’s subpar performance since going public last year. Secondly, users pay absolutely nothing for using Instagram's services; there is no price per photo uploaded, monthly/annual subscription required, or pricing scheme of any sort. Individuals and celebrities are not the only ones who derive personal benefit from Instagram, but businesses, too. Many small businesses like to use Instagram as a marketing tool because it is free and effective. For instance, some will upload pictures of new product arrivals to lure new and/or existing customers to come in and purchase. Not to mention, businesses like to have Instagram accounts because the service allows them to build their brand and customer loyalty through daily/weekly posts, thus, giving them the venue to engage and interact with customers in ways they could not do previously. Question How much, if any, of our information should Instagram be able to share with third-parties and advertisers? OR Why are Instagram users making such a fuss about the revised privacy policy if they are gaining so much personal satisfaction and/or business from a service that is free?   1 http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/01/how-many-users-does-instagram-have/61139/ 2 http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/18/technology/social/instagram-sell-photos/index.html?iid=s_mpm#comments 3 http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening 4 http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/ 5 http://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/#section3 6 http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/01/21/instagram-reports-90-million-active-monthly-users-plus-three-business-tips/   This ethics case was written by Alexis Babb and Amanda Nelson, both seniors at Santa Clara University and Hackworth Fellows in Business Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/cases-in-global-business-ethics/factory-fires-in-bangladesh-who-is-responsible.html,Cases in Global Business Ethics - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Cases in Global Business Ethics Factory Fires in Bangladesh: Who Is Responsible? The largest Bangladesh factory fire in recent times killed 112 people this last November. This horrible incident raises once again the dilemma of who bears responsibility in such a tragedy. As we examine this case, we have singled out specific players who might bear significant responsibility for this particular event. The Bangladeshi government has the dual responsibility of taking care of its citizens as well as maintaining its economy by supporting the $20 billion-a-year garment industry that serves as 80% of its total export earnings. The workers, mostly women, earn as little as $37 per month and depend on the government for their safety; however, corruption runs rampant in Bangladeshi politics and the country is currently ranked 142nd out of a 176 countries according to the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. In this case, there are also implications of arson to further political interests of specific parties. Additionally, the owner of the factory constructed five more illegal floors beyond the original structure, and the factory location was in an area in which large vehicles, specifically fire trucks, could not easily enter. Major international retailers have often been criticized for not taking responsibility for their subcontractors; companies whose products were produced at this particular factory include major retailers such as Walmart and Sears. Do you think that it is the government’s responsibility to enforce safety regulations and bring these factories up to date or should more be done by multinational corporations that use these factories in order to ensure the safety of their supply chain employees? We assign the majority of responsibility in this case to the government, which has failed to protect its citizens and factory workers on multiple occasions. This most recent factory fire, although more deadly than any in recent memory, is unfortunately not a rarity in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi government fails to properly enforce safety standards they set because they fear the impact that those regulations would have on the garment exports. Although there has been an initial outcry against major companies, such as Sears and Walmart, who have subcontracted labor to different Bangladeshi factories, we believe that they are less culpable than the Bangladeshi government because of their degrees of separation from the actual event. Although we recognize the financial constraints and the associated corruption faced by the Bangladeshi government, we believe that only a local authority could create significant change in how safety is valued. The bottom line is that if the government regulations were properly enforced, factory fires, which are all too common in Bangladesh, would reduce in number resulting in safer working conditions for factory employees. Bringing these factories up to code would, however, create another cost for factory owners. This cost could either cut into the owner’s profits, cut the wages of factory workers, or be paid for by an increase in production costs paid for by subcontractors, which would be passed on to the multinational corporations that use these facilities to create goods. Ultimately, there is a tradeoff here between profit and safety. It has been estimated that a quarter of the factories in Dhaka are not up to current safety codes. If the government enforces these regulations, there will be less business generated because costs would increase, but the factory employees would be able to work in a safe environment and disasters like this fire would become much less likely. Who do you think bears responsibility for this tragedy? What other ethical frameworks (social, political, etc…) can help unpack this complicated scenario? How would you use these other frameworks to decide who is responsible? Is your answer an ideal or realistic scenario? Explain.

She also asks you to say that she voluntarily left the company to address a family medical crisis, and that the company was pleased with her work. You like this person and believe she is a good worker when she is not drinking.

The site registers members for $30, who are then allowed to bid on exceptional deals. In an effort to stand out from the crowded field of online bargain sites, Fashionforward! reached out to the local community in search of help marketing their company to college students. Part of this effort included hiring a student intern, Carly LeBlanc. At that point, Fashionforward! had no formal marketing strategy for targeting consumers. As someone who grew up in the digital age, LeBlanc knew she had to kick start the company on the Internet. Her marketing knowledge centered on the benefits of viral technologies, especially Facebook and Twitter. LeBlanc immediately revamped the Fashionforward! Facebook page to make it more user-friendly--adding quizzes, polls, discussion boards, and photo albums--as well as setting Twitter blasts to go off repeatedly throughout the day. During her three-month internship, LeBlanc quadrupled the Fashionforward! Facebook fan base. Her project helped catapult the company into prominence. In the three months of her internship, Fashionforward! increased the number of items offered on the site threefold. The CEO noticed LeBlanc's success in social networking and asked her to launch a guerrilla marketing campaign on her own campus to create buzz for Fashionforward! among her peers. The CEO challenged her to register 100 new clients within the week. A member of a sorority since her freshman year, LeBlanc decided to use her Greek connections. She appeared at four campus sororities that week. Promising a free Fashionforward! T-shirt with the sorority's name for every membership purchased, LeBlanc registered 300 new members in one night. Reporting to work the next day, LeBlanc was excited to share with the team the quick acceptance Fashionforward! had received on campus. She believed she had developed an easy and effective marketing strategy that could be replicated at schools all over the country. LeBlanc planned to order different T-shirt designs for different sororities, highlighting the Fashionforward! logo in bold lettering. That's when she faced a difficult ethical decision: She could order the shirts from a low-cost company in China or she could order them from a fair-trade company in San Francisco, which provided safe conditions and higher wages for the workers who made the clothing. The fair trade shirts were $28.65,making the grand total for her project $8,595. In contrast, the Chinese T-shirts were $5.50 each, and the company's Web site promised fast and free delivery for a grand total of $1,100. LeBlanc remembered from her Venture Capital Finance class that startup companies need to focus on making the most money during the first two years. She also knew that the T-shirts from China would be cheaper so that she could create a more elaborate design with more graphics and color. She realized her school was a ""testing campus"" for Fashionforward! and that if her marketing module worked, her internship work would spread to other college campuses. She thought of how easy it would be for a factory in China to produce large quantities of shirts to give away for free as a promotion that she could promote on the Facebook page she had worked so hard on. She also wondered if the higher cost of the T-shirts would affect the grade the CEO gave her for the internship. On the other hand, her International Management class had exposed her to the harsh reality of working conditions in China: low wages, rigorous work schedule, poor safety regulations, and the complete lack of worker's compensation and benefits. When LeBlanc had sailed on the Human Rights and Social Justice Voyage with University of Virginia's Semester at Sea, she saw first-hand a Bulgarian clothing factory's destitute environment. She wasn't sure how the public would react if they knew Passionita had taken advantage of outsourcing cheaper t-shirts rather than supporting a U.S. company during the global recession. Then LeBlanc weighed her other option of ordering t-shirts from a San Francisco T-shirt company she had already used once when she worked with a community service student organization. While the shirts were more expensive, they were fair-trade, organic, and eco-friendly, all attributes she thought would appeal to students. LeBlanc reasoned students would be more likely to wear a shirt that was fashionable and better quality than one that was made cheaply. LeBlanc didn't want to disappoint her boss. She knew she was working on a deadline and didn't have time to research the prices of T-shirts at other companies. Even though she could have created a bidding war with local T-shirt companies for the business, she preferred to buy from a company that she could trust. At the same time, the $7,495 she would save if she bought from the Chinese manufacturer was too good not to consider. She knew if she made her boss happy, she'd be promoted and enjoy more independence with her future projects. LeBlanc wants Fashionforward! to increase its popularity and become a topnotch company among college trendsetters. What should she do and why? Should she quit her internship and drop the class? Should she ask for an extension on her assignment? Should she order the T-shirts from a fair trade company? Should she assume the Chinese company doesn't treat its workers fairly?

As assistant editor, Luke's main responsibility was to take the ""editor's cut"" of a film and break it down to get it ready for promotional distribution and sound mixing. Luke's job dealt heavily with confidentiality. Friends and family members would often ask him for ""the dirt"" on the latest releases, especially with large-scale Hollywood productions. Because of these external factors, Luke and all other employee s of the production company were forced to sign confidentiality agreements at the beginning of employment. If these agreements were breached, the employee could be terminated and legally prosecuted. The company had suffered from ""leaks"" in the past that resulted in harmful consequences such as lawsuits by the affected production companies. Most recently, Luke worked on the trailer for a highly anticipated third film of a trilogy. Hollywood and its many fans were itching to get a glimpse of the latest special effects and techniques used in the film. Luke's family and friends, though they were aware of his contractual obligations, pressured him to tell them about the film. Luke refused. ""I would undoubtedly choose not to do something like this-not just because it's unethical-but because I could get fired,"" he said. Even with the tight security, Luke arrived at work one morning to find that his trailer had leaked onto the Internet and was available on fan websites and blogs. The trailer had already been passed for inspection to other employees, so it was impossible to determine where the leak originated. Luke worried about the security of his job-although this leak wasn't his fault, he feared repercussions from the filmmaker and producers who entrusted him with their movie. To his surprise, the leaked version of the trailer inspired a cult following in advance of the upcoming release. Instead of hurting sales and revealing secrets, the leaked trailer drew a bigger crowd than expected and sparked unintentional advertising via the Internet. ""I take the confidentiality agreements seriously-anyone in this industry has to,"" said Luke. ""I don' t know who leaked the video, but I'm lucky that it helped the movie. If it hadn't, I would have faced a lot of pressure from those above me and struggled to regain their trust.""

Larry Cook began working in Hollywood just after graduating in communication from Santa Clara University. As a recent graduate, he didn't have his pick of jobs and started with what the industry considered a ""bottom-feeder"" production company. This company produced trailers for films that were often not very good and big economic risks. Though this wasn't the rosy picture Larry had imagined of Hollywood, he knew he had to start somewhere. Larry was immediately put in charge of advertising for a recently acquired movie. The movie had terrible action, horrible writing and the directing and cinematography left a lot to be desired. But Larry couldn't dwell on the poor quality. Instead, he had to focus on putting together a trailer to entice distribution companies at the Cannes Film Festival to pick it up and put it in their theatres. ""My job was to show how the movie would appeal to mass audiences,"" said Larry. ""And I had to do it all alone."" Ted Brown, Larry's superior and the producer of the trailer, only worked on extremely low-budget projects. Instead of building a creative collaboration with Larry, Brown simply told Larry what to do with the trailer. ""I was forced to find something good in the movie to cut together to make an enticing trailer,"" said Larry. But Larry struggled to see any good qualities to advertise in the dull and formulaic movie. ""It strangled my creative passion for producing,"" said Larry. ""It made me question my motives for working on the project."" Disheartened with what he had to work with and the cynical assistance he received from his boss, Larry was forced to do the best with what he had to work with. In the end, he created a somewhat enticing trailer for a movie he hated. ""People say there is no truth in advertising and that trailers lie,"" said Larry, ""I would agree with that statement."" Larry used this first experience as a stepping stone to other options within the production industry. While his first job was quite possibly the worst, he has encountered similar issues, to a lesser degree, in each subsequent job. ""In this industry I'm forced to bend the truth to make the product look more appealing. But the general public should realize what I'm doing,"" he said.

The workplace had a casual atmosphere, she enjoyed a salary far above that of her friends, she received perks regularly and she enjoyed Mai-Tai Fridays at the office every week. She was at the job for less than two months when the company released the quarterly numbers. As the internal communications representative, Barbara was responsible for reporting the numbers to all the employees within the company. Because the company was not publicly traded, only those within the organization were privy to the information. ""I was aware something wasn't quite right with the numbers,"" said Barbara. ""But I was so young and naive-I never thought they could be wrong."" She knew the company was doing well, but Barbara had been tracking the high-tech industry and was conscious of the usual financial targets. She also knew that the industry was getting out of control and each company was willing to do anything to get ahead. After asking her coworkers, she realized that they all knew the numbers were intentionally inflated every quarter.

Rachel Bailey was quickly hired out of Santa Clara University during the dot-com boom to a company of 100 employees that ran an innovative social networking website in Silicon Valley. She was immediately put in charge of email communication to customers-both existing and potential. The Internet was quite new to everyone and online communication (via email) had little corporate regulation or set social protocol. Privacy policies were yet to be established. With thousands of individuals discovering the Internet everyday, business was booming for the small Silicon Valley firm. Rachel handled all online contact with existing users and was asked to market to these existing online community members via email. But she struggled with finding a balance of the right amount of marketing. With Internet competition growing everyday within the social networking websites, these users had plenty of alternatives. And flooding their email inboxes, she thought, wasn't the best way to attract them. Unfortunately, Rachel's boss had a different approach. The Vice President of Marketing wanted results-he wanted existing customers to upgrade their networking packages and follow through on advertisements. He told Rachel to be as aggressive as possible with her email campaigns. But at the same time, Rachel spoke with coworkers who didn't want to work for a company known for its email spam. They prided themselves on working at an organization that respected its users and didn't abuse the ease of email communication-even within the competitive market. Rachel found subtle alternatives to the mass emails. She developed links on the company website to advertisements, but she wasn' t getting the results her boss demanded. One day when Rachel arrived at the office, her boss said he had a brilliant idea. He said that everybody knew someone named Cindy Anderson, so they could send emails to their users from that name to trick them into opening the email, which would display a link to their website. Rachel was incensed with her boss's idea. ""A lot of people are very casual with the truth,"" she said. Rachel felt very uncomfortable with the thought of implementing what she considered to be her boss's deceptive idea. ""People trust you with their email addresses,"" said Rachel. ""You have to be responsible and not take advantage of that access."" She worried that existing customers would begin to resent the company and unsubscribe. But she also had a commitment to drawing in as many new customers as she could-and her more subtle tactics weren't working. Rachel made the decision to stand up to her boss. The following week she told him that his idea was deceitful and would cause customers to lose trust and faith in the company. In the end, it wouldn't be a financially viable solution to their problem. Rachel proved to be convincing. Her boss took her advice and began to realize that it was a bad idea. ""In the end, we had happy customers and our company gained more value in the highly competitive market,"" said Rachel.

""In the advertising industry, money is the bottom line-regardless,"" said Peter Allen, a customer service representative for a large-scale online directory. It was 1999 and the online business was booming. Everyone in the city wanted to get in on the Internet revolution, but many didn't really understand what that even involved. Peter was new to the industry. He was given his territory, the city of San Francisco, and told to sell as much advertising as possible-at any cost-both to the company's existing clients and to new customers. For his first few months on the job, Peter focused on getting to know the existing customers and evaluating their current advertising packages with the company. Peter was surprised to find that many of his customers were small business owners-auto-body shops and family-owned restaurants that already had large advertising packages way beyond their needs. His boss, the director of customer service, had already set Peter's quota at a level that presumed that many more sales were possible. Yet, in Peter's judgment, the market was saturated. ""These small shops thought that the Internet was the next best thing,"" said Peter. ""They didn't even understand what the Internet actually was."" Peter couldn't fathom how these small businesses got persuaded into spending so much money on advertising. ""The businesses you would least think to look up online were the businesses with the most expensive advertising packages,"" said Peter. Peter was getting daily phone calls from the home office, pressuring him to meet his numbers and sell the most in his territory. Peter complained to the sales manager, who said that Peter had to be honest. ""It was my obligation to set things straight,"" said Peter. With the support of his manager, Peter told the top executives of the company that the sales team in San Francisco needed to have some leeway in meeting the quota. Unlike other sales territories, San Francisco, as the hub of the high-tech world, was cluttered with competition and, with companies cropping up everywhere in Silicon Valley, Peter and his team didn't have the luxury to selectively pursue businesses. Instead, they had to go after any and every business possible because other online directories were quickly entering the San Francisco market. The executives feared that changing the quota for San Francisco would lead to other territories vying for lower quotas as well. But Peter's case proved strong enough: The executives decided to ""look the other way"" for the San Francisco territory. Peter went to each business and gave them an honest evaluation of their advertising needs-often recommending they downgrade their packages with the company. ""We moved them into more appropriate packages and became number one in customer retention,"" said Peter. ""We lost money in the short term, but in the long term we made money through referrals and retention.""

Danielle graduated from Santa Clara University and quickly got a job in the television industry as a production assistant. Soon after entering the business, she was disheartened to find the degree to which the industry was all about profit. She watched major networks lay off hundreds of employees and make significant structural changes, what seemed to her a reckless destruction of successful shows. ""Because of the focus on immediate profit, these networks don't take any risks,"" she said. ""They look to the cookie-cutter model television shows instead of looking to independent producers. They want the control of their own shows and, therefore, virtually eliminate any outside creativity."" Danielle worked for an independent production company which, despite its recent successes, still struggled to make it in the world of production. Its last comedy sitcom was a hit but was canceled after seven years because of low revenue. Though viewership remained high, the networks were only interested in purchasing shows that would lead to future syndication and DVD sales-therefore having the ability to give the network profit for years to come. But independent producers were thinking about profits along the same lines as the networks. Because of such future potential profits, independent producers were hanging on tenaciously to rights to the possible future syndication and DVD sales. Danielle's independent company owned the show and the rights to future syndication profits and wasn't willing to give them up. Since the future profits were tied up, the network dropped the show. ""If our company produced a pilot that was hilarious, had a great cast and tested through the roof, no network would buy it because they wouldn't be given money later on,"" said Danielle. As a result, great scripts never reach the television screen. ""Independent producers want access to future profits-they know their shows are creative and could really take off if given the chance,"" said Danielle, ""but the industry is so focused on future profits that they are willing to take a lower quality show and hope it makes it to syndication."" Most of these shows don't make it past 100 episodes (what you need to syndicate) because the show is bad to begin with. ""If I had the power to fight, I would,"" said Danielle. ""But I would be taking on an entire industry structure. I generally just shake my head and wonder what happened to the television industry."" ""The focus on the bottom line makes me want to go back to film or just get out altogether,"" she said. And, as a result of this system, Danielle thought, a perverse law of supply and demand was set in place: Potentially great, independently produced shows never get past the development stage while banal productions get bought, but then aren't good enough to get to syndication.

Five years after graduating from Santa Clara University, Ilene Kennedy got a job in contract sales, selling high-end office furniture to large companies throughout Northern California. Ilene was a manufacturer's rep who represented ten lines of furniture to dealers who then sold the furniture to the end user-law firms and financial companies in remodel or expansion processes. Ilene had learned about the strict chain-of-custody within the contract furniture industry from a close friend in the business. This chain was a custom in the business which permitted only certain individuals to sell to and represent those immediately above or below them in the ""ladder."" In the system, designers and architects who were remodeling law firms and company offices specified furniture to buy from the dealers who would, in turn, buy the furniture from the manufacturer. As a manufacturer's representative, Ilene would only be selling to dealers, architects and designers. She would not be selling to end users. But when this chain-of-custody system was explained to Ilene by her new boss, he told her that, in reality, it often didn't work that way. He had hired Ilene to sell directly to the law firms and companies-thereby cutting out the dealers, architects and designers. By eliminating the dealers, architects and designers in the process, Ilene's firm could make a bigger profit margin. In many large deals, Ilene was bidding against dealers, architects and designers she often worked closely with-dealers she was supposed to be using at the time. The entire process made Ilene feel very uncomfortable-she felt like she was cheating the system. It was apparent that her company was using a less accepted strategy. After a couple months, she brought the concern to her boss, the owner of the company, who was completely unsupportive. Her boss told her that she was, ""too idealistic and not a true salesperson."" They were in the business to make money, not to make friends. He said she could leave if she didn't feel comfortable with the arrangement. ""I just realized I was hired for a position that was completely unethical,"" said Ilene. Frustrated, Ilene did her best to balance both her role as a manufacturer's representative and her forced role in the bidding wars. On several occasions she bowed out of potential deals with end-users when she was faced with bidding against her own dealer client. In these instances the dealers knew that Ilene was going after the profit. She wasn't proud of the strategy and, knowing well that she may have to work with the dealers in the future, she decided to take herself out of the awkward situations. But Ilene couldn't handle the balance. ""I told my boss that I was uncomfortable selling to the end-users for ethical reasons,"" said Ilene. For the next six months, Ilene only sold to dealers and designers-as the chain-of-custody intended it. ""The option was less lucrative for me and for the company, but at least I was doing what I thought was right and fair,"" said Ilene. After those six months, Ilene quit the job and began a sales job in another industry where she's found ground-breaking success.

Gail Ellen had taken her first job offer out of Santa Clara University. As a communication major, she hoped to go into broadcast media and eventually become an on-air personality. But she knew she had to work her way up. So she took a job with a local Bay Area radio station in the publicity department. Gail immediately fell in love with the station's young, hip vibe. Soon after beginning at the radio station, Gail began to feel uncomfortable about some of the practices within the promotions department. When station officials requested products from local companies to be given away on-air, they would overestimate the amount necessary. The employees would then take the extra products. This happened several times with tanning packages. A local tanning salon would often donate coupons for free one-month trials. The station didn't have a set ratio for coupon dollar amount per minute of advertising, so the promotions department would negotiate individually with each customer. It was also impossible for the individual companies to keep track of the on-air advertising time, so they never knew if their negotiated airtime was actually in effect. These negotiations resulted in a completely arbitrary system that always erred on the side of the station. Instead of giving all the tanning packages away on the air, the disc jockeys would often keep a few for personal use, or distribute them to other station employees. Because everyone at the station enjoyed receiving the perks, nobody complained. ""I enjoyed the industry,"" said Gail. ""I'm just glad I wasn't on the other side of the street."" Gail realized that the supporting companies donating give-aways had no idea of the radio station's practices. This frustrated her, but she, too, didn't feel it was worth speaking up about.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/client-obligations-and-handling-your-boss/,Client Obligations and Handling Your Boss - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Client Obligations and Handling Your Boss Rosie Alexander had recently lost her job from the dot-com bust when she decided to switch industries and join a medium-sized consulting firm where she helped individual clients manage their personal portfolios. Although the firm wasn't the top in the market, the firm had several long-term clients who gave them a good reputation amongst peers. One long-term client, Betty Fitz, emailed Rosie's boss, Conor Hall, asking a few questions about a recent acquisition of stock. Conor forwarded the inquiries to Rosie, asking her for help. Rosie, new to the job and not fully aware of Ms. Fitz's financial background, wasn't able to answer all of Ms. Fitz's questions-they needed to be put to someone with more expertise. So she wrote an email back to Conor, letting him know that she needed more information before she could fully evaluate Ms. Fitz's situation. She explicitly stated in the email to Conor that her reply was an inquiry for further information and was not meant to be forwarded on to Ms. Fritz. Rosie felt her answer was still in an informal, rough form and left many questions unanswered. A few days later, Ms. Fitz emailed Conor again, asking if he had gotten her questions answered. In a rush, Conor forwarded Rosie's email to Ms. Fitz. Later, he told Rosie that he felt her response was good enough and that he didn't have the time to waste composing a whole new document. When Ms. Fitz complained about the lack of detail in the response, Conor placed the blame on Rosie, his ""clearly incompetent assistant."" ""He messed with my reputation,"" said Rosie. ""I don't normally like to create commotion, but I felt this was a necessary battle I had to fight."" In Rosie's mind, Conor had not only lied to a client and implicated her, he had also damaged her professional reputation with a longstanding client. She looked unreliable. Rosie approached Conor the following day and said that all he needed to tell Ms. Fitz was that he had forgotten or hadn't gotten a chance to look at it yet. Either way, each answer would have made him appear busy-something completely justifiable to the client. And even if Rosie had messed up, she told Conor that she would expect him to either fire her or cover for her-not damage her reputation and leave her unable to defend herself. Surprisingly, Conor agreed and apologized to Rosie-and later apologized to Ms. Fitz. Discussion Questions: Jessica Silliman was a 2006-07 Hackworth Fellow at The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/worldcom-case-study-update/,WorldCom Case Study Update - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"WorldCom Case Study Update Read the original case. In December 2005, two years after this case was written, the telecommunications industry consolidated further. Verizon Communications acquired MCI/WorldCom and SBC Communications acquired AT&T Corporation, which had been in business since the 19th Century. The acquisition of MCI/WorldCom was the direct result of the behavior of WorldCom's senior managers as documented above. While it can be argued that the demise of AT&T Corp. was not wholly attributable to WorldCom's behavior, AT&T Corp.'s decimation certainly was facilitated by the events surrounding WorldCom, since WorldCom was the benchmark long distance telephone and Internet communications service provider. Indeed, the ripple effect of WorldCom's demise goes far beyond one company and several senior managers. It had a profound effect on an entire industry. This postscript will update the WorldCom story by focusing on what happened to the company after it declared bankruptcy and before it was acquired by Verizon. The postscript also will relate subsequent important events in the telecommunications industry, the effect of WorldCom's problems on its competitors and labor market, and the impact WorldCom had on the lives of the key players associated with the fraud and its exposure. From Benchmark to Bankrupt Between July 2002 when WorldCom declared bankruptcy and April 2004 when it emerged from bankruptcy as MCI, company officials worked feverishly to restate the financials and reorganize the company. The new CEO Michael Capellas (formerly CEO of Compaq Computer) and the newly appointed CFO Robert Blakely faced the daunting task of settling the company's outstanding debt of around $35 billion and performing a rigorous financial audit of the company. This was a monumental task, at one point utilizing an army of over 500 WorldCom employees, over 200 employees of the company's outside auditor, KPMG, and a supplemental workforce of almost 600 people from Deloitte & Touch. As Joseph McCafferty notes, ""(a)t the peak of the audit, in late 2003, WorldCom had about 1,500 people working on the restatement, under the combined management of Blakely and five controllers…(the t) otal cost to complete it: a mind-blowing $365 million""(McCafferty, 2004). In addition to revealing sloppy and fraudulent bookkeeping, the post-bankruptcy audit found two important new pieces of information that only served to increase the amount of fraud at WorldCom. First, ""WorldCom had overvalued several acquisitions by a total of $5.8 billion""(McCafferty, 2004). In addition, Sullivan and Ebbers, ""had claimed a pretax profit for 2000 of $7.6 billion"" (McCafferty, 2004). In reality, WorldCom lost ""$48.9 billion (including a $47 billion write-down of impaired assets)."" Consequently, instead of a $10 billion profit for the years 2000 and 2001, WorldCom had a combined loss for the years 2000 through 2002 (the year it declared bankruptcy) of $73.7 billion. If the $5.8 billion of overvalued assets is added to this figure, the total fraud at WorldCom amounted to a staggering $79.5 billion. Although the newly audited financial statements exposed the impact of the WorldCom fraud on the company's shareholders, creditors, and other stakeholders, other information made public since 2002 revealed the effects of the fraud on the company's competitors and the telecommunications industry as a whole. These show that the fall of WorldCom altered the fortunes of a number of telecommunications industry participants, none more so than AT&T Corporation. The CNBC news show, ""The Big Lie: Inside the Rise and Fraud of WorldCom,"" exposed the extent of the WorldCom fraud on several key participants, including the then-chairmen of AT&T and Sprint (Faber, 2003). The so-called ""big lie"" was promoted through a spreadsheet developed by Tom Stluka, a capacity planner at WorldCom, that modeled in Excel format the amount of traffic WorldCom could expect in a best-case scenario of Internet growth. In essence, ""Stluka's model suggested that in the best of all possible worlds Internet traffic would double every 100 days"" (Faber, 2003). In working with the model, Stluka simply assigned variables with various parameters to ""whatever we think is appropriate""(Faber, 2003). This was innocent enough, had it remained an exercise. A problem emerged when the exercise was extended and integrated into corporate strategy, when it was adopted and implemented by WorldCom and then by the telecommunications industry. Within a year, ""other companies were touting it"" and the model was given credibility it should not have been accorded (Faber, 2003). As Stluka explains, ""there were a lot of people who were saying 10X growth, doubling every three to four months, doubling every 100 days, 1,000 percent, that kind of thing"" (Faber, 2003). But it wasn't true. ""I don't recall traffic ... in fact growing at that rate … still, WorldCom's lie had become an immutable law."" Optimistic scenarios with little foundation in reality began to spread and pervade the industry. They became emblematic of the ""smoke and mirrors"" behavior not only at WorldCom prior to its collapse, but the industry as a whole. Fictitious numbers drove not just WorldCom, but also other companies as they reacted to WorldCom's optimistic projections. According to Michael Armstrong, then chairman and CEO of AT&T, ""For some period of time, I can recall that we were back-filling that expectation with laying cable, something like 2,200 miles of cable an hour"" (Faber, 2003). He adds: ""Think of all the companies that went out of business that assumed that that was real."" The fallout from the WorldCom debacle was significant. Verizon obtained the freshly minted MCI for $7.6 billion, but not the $35 billion of debt MCI had when it declared bankruptcy (Alexander, 2005). Although WorldCom was one of the largest telecommunications companies with nearly $160 billion in assets, shareholder suits obtained $6.1 billion from a variety of sources including investment banks, former board members and auditors of WorldCom (Belson, 2005). If this sum were evenly distributed among the firms 2.968 billion common shares, the payoff would (have been) well under $1 a share for a stock that peaked at $49.91 on Jan. 2000"" (Alexander, 2005, 3). There are more losers in the aftermath of the WorldCom wreck. The reemerged MCI was left with about 55,000 employees, down from 88,000 at its peak. Since March 2001, however, ""about 300,000 telecommunications workers have lost their jobs. The sector's total employment-1.032 million-is at an eight year low"" (Alexander, 2005, 3). The carnage does not stop there. Telecommunications equipment manufacturers such as Lucent Technologies, Nortell Networks, and Corning, while benefiting initially from WorldCom's groundless predictions, suffered in the end with layoffs and depressed share prices. Perhaps most significant, in December 2005, the venerable AT&T Corporation ceased to exist as an independent company. The Impact on Individuals The WorldCom fiasco had a permanent effect on the lives of its key players as well. Cynthia Cooper, who spearheaded the uncovering of the fraud, went on to become one of Time Magazine's 2002 Persons of the Year. She also received a number of awards, including the 2003 Accounting Exemplar Award, given to an individual who has made notable contributions to professionalism and ethics in accounting practice or education. At present, she travels extensively, speaking to students and professionals about the importance of strong ethical and moral leadership in business (Nationwide Speakers Bureau, 2004). Even so, as Dennis Moberg points out, ""After Ebbers and Sullivan left the company, ""...Cooper was treated less positively than her virtuous acts warranted. In an interview with her on 11 May 2005, she indicated that, for two years following their departure, her salary was frozen, her auditing position authority was circumscribed, and her budget was cut""""(Moberg, 2006, 416). As far as the protagonists are concerned, in April 2002, CEO Bernie Ebbers resigned and two months later, CFO Scott Sullivan was fired. Shortly thereafter, in August 2002, Sullivan and former Controller David Myers were arrested and charged with securities fraud. In November 2002, former Compaq chief Michael Capellas was named CEO of WorldCom and in April 2003, Robert Blakely was named the company's CFO. In March 2004, Sullivan pleaded guilty to criminal charges (McCafferty, 2004). At that time, too, Ebbers was formally charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of securities fraud, and seven counts of fraud related to false filings with the Security and Exchange Commission (United States District Court - Southern District of New York, 2004). Two months later, in May of 2004, Citigroup settled class action litigation for $1.64 billion after-tax brought on behalf of purchasers of WorldCom securities (Citigroup Inc., 2004). In like manner, JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $2 billion to settle claims by investors that it should have known WorldCom's books were fraudulent when it helped sell $5 billion in company bonds (Rovella, 2005). On March 15, 2005, Ebbers was found guilty of all charges and on July 13th of that year, sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, which was possibly a life sentence for the 63-year-old. He was expected to report to a federal prison on October 12th, but remained free while his lawyers appealed his conviction (Pappalardo, 2005). At the time of his conviction, Ebbers' lawyers claimed the judge in the case gave the jury inappropriate instructions about Ebbers' knowledge of WorldCom's accounting fraud (Pappalardo, 2005). By January of 2006, Reid Weingarten, Ebber's lawyer, was claiming that the previous trial was manipulated against Ebbers because three high level WorldCom executives were barred from testifying on Ebbers' behalf. At that time, too, Judge Jose Cabranes of the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals commented, ""There are many violent criminals who don't get 25 years in prison. Twenty years does seem an awfully long time"" (MacIntyre, 2006). Weingarten went on to assert that the government ""should have charged the three former WorldCom employees that could have helped exonerate Ebbers or let them go"" (Reporter, 2006). He charged, too, that ""the jury was wrongly instructed that it could convict Ebbers on the basis of so-called ""conscious avoidance"" of knowledge of the fraud at WorldCom"" (Reporter, 2006). Perhaps most compellingly, Weingarten called into question the fairness of Ebbers' sentence that was five times as long as that given to ex-WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan (Reporter, 2006). Weingarten's claims are not without merit. In August 2005, former CFO Sullivan was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in engineering the $11 billion accounting fraud. His relatively light sentence was part of a bargain wherein he agreed to plead guilty to the charges filed against him and to cooperate with prosecutors as they built a case against Ebbers. In doing so, Sullivan became the prosecution's main witness against Ebbers and the only person to testify that he discussed the WorldCom fraud directly with Ebbers (Ferranti, 2005). Others involved in the scandal were also treated less harshly than Ebbers. In September 2005, judgments were rendered approving settlement and dismissing action against David Myers and a number of others associated with WorldCom (United States District Court - Southern District of New York, Judgment Approving Settlement and Dismissing Action Against Buford Yates and David Myers, 2005, Judgment Approving Settlement and Dismissing Action Against James C. Allen, Judith Areen, Carl J. Aycock, Max E. Bobbitt, Clifford L. Alexander, Jr., Francesco Galesi, Stiles A. Kellett, Jr., Gordon S. Macklin, John A. Porter, Bert C. Roberts, Jr., The Estate of John W. Sidgmore, and Lawrence C. Tucker, 2005). At the time of this update, Ebbers has been convicted by a court of law, but remains free on bail while he pursues an appeal. Although the extent of his punishment is under contention, one thing remains clear - that Ebbers and the other officers at WorldCom are guilty of presiding over what is to date, the largest corporate fraud in history.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/worldcom/,WorldCom - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"WorldCom An update for this case is available. 2002 saw an unprecedented number of corporate scandals: Enron, Tyco, Global Crossing. In many ways, WorldCom is just another case of failed corporate governance, accounting abuses, and outright greed. But none of these other companies had senior executives as colorful and likable as Bernie Ebbers. A Canadian by birth, the 6 foot, 3 inch former basketball coach and Sunday School teacher emerged from the collapse of WorldCom not only broke but with a personal net worth as a negative nine-digit number.2 No palace in a gated community, no stable of racehorses or multi-million dollar yacht to show for the telecommunications giant he created. Only debts and red ink--results some consider inevitable given his unflagging enthusiasm and entrepreneurial flair. There is no question that he did some pretty bad stuff, but he really wasn't like the corporate villains of his day: Andy Fastow of Enron, Dennis Koslowski of Tyco, or Gary Winnick of Global Crossing.3 Personally, Bernie is a hard guy not to like. In 1998 when Bernie was in the midst of acquiring the telecommunications firm MCI, Reverend Jesse Jackson, speaking at an all-black college near WorldCom's Mississippi headquarters, asked how Ebbers could afford $35 billion for MCI but hadn't donated funds to local black students. Businessman LeRoy Walker Jr., was in the audience at Jackson's speech, and afterwards set him straight. Ebbers had given over $1 million plus loads of information technology to that black college. ""Bernie Ebbers,"" Walker reportedly told Jackson, ""is my mentor.""4 Rev. Jackson was won over, but who wouldn't be by this erstwhile milkman and bar bouncer who serves meals to the homeless at Frank's Famous Biscuits in downtown Jackson, Mississippi, and wears jeans, cowboy boots, and a funky turquoise watch to work. It was 1983 in a coffee shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi that Mr. Ebbers first helped create the business concept that would become WorldCom. ""Who could have thought that a small business in itty bitty Mississippi would one day rival AT&T?"" asked an editorial in Jackson, Mississippi's Clarion-Ledger newspaper.5 Bernie's fall-and the company's-was abrupt. In June 1999 with WorldCom's shares trading at $64, he was a billionaire,6 and WorldCom was the darling of the New Economy. By early May of 2002, Ebbers resigned his post as CEO, declaring that he was ""1,000 percent convinced in my heart that this is a temporary thing.""7 Two months later, in spite of Bernie's unflagging optimism, WorldCom declared itself the largest bankruptcy in American history.8  This case describes three major issues in the fall of WorldCom: the corporate strategy of growth through acquisition, the use of loans to senior executives, and threats to corporate governance created by chumminess and lack of arm's-length dealing. The case concludes with a brief description of the hero of the case-whistle blower Cynthia Cooper. The Growth Through Acquisition Merry-Go-Round From its humble beginnings as an obscure long distance telephone company WorldCom, through the execution of an aggressive acquisition strategy, evolved into the second-largest long distance telephone company in the United States and one of the largest companies handling worldwide Internet data traffic.9 According to the WorldCom Web site, at its high point, the company WorldCom achieved its position as a significant player in the telecommunications industry through the successful completion of 65 acquisitions.11 Between 1991 and 1997, WorldCom spent almost $60 billion in the acquisition of many of these companies and accumulated $41 billion in debt.12 Two of these acquisitions were particularly significant. The MFS Communications acquisition enabled WorldCom to obtain UUNet, a major supplier of Internet services to business, and MCI Communications gave WorldCom one of the largest providers of business and consumer telephone service. By 1997, WorldCom's stock had risen from pennies per share to over $60 a share.13 Through what appeared to be a prescient and successful business strategy at the height of the Internet boom, WorldCom became a darling of Wall Street. In the heady days of the technology bubble Wall Street took notice of WorldCom and its then visionary CEO, Bernie Ebbers. This was a company ""on the move,"" and Wall Street investment banks, analysts and brokers began to discover WorldCom's value and make ""strong buy recommendations"" to investors. As this process began to unfold, the analysts' recommendations, coupled with the continued rise of the stock market, made WorldCom stock desirable, and the market's view of the stock was that it could only go up. As the stock value went up, it was easier for WorldCom to use stock as the vehicle to continue to purchase additional companies. The acquisition of MFS Communications and MCI Communications were, perhaps, the most significant in the long list of WorldCom acquisitions. With the acquisition of MFS Communications and its UUNet unit, ""WorldCom (s)uddenly had an investment story to offer about the value of combining long distance, local service and data communications.""14 In late 1997, British Telecommunications Corporation made a $19 billion bid for MCI. Very quickly, Ebbers made a counter offer of $30 billion in WorldCom stock. In addition, Ebbers agreed to assume $5 billion in MCI debt, making the deal $35 billion or 1.8 times the value of the British Telecom offer. MCI took WorldCom's offer making WorldCom a truly significant global telecommunications company.15  All this would be just another story of a successful growth strategy if it weren't for one significant business reality--mergers and acquisitions, especially large ones, present significant managerial challenges in at least two areas. First, management must deal with the challenge of integrating new and old organizations into a single smoothly functioning business. This is a time-consuming process that involves thoughtful planning and considerable senior managerial attention if the acquisition process is to increase the value of the firm to both shareholders and stakeholders. With 65 acquisitions in six years and several of them large ones, WorldCom management had a great deal on their plate. The second challenge is the requirement to account for the financial aspects of the acquisition. The complete financial integration of the acquired company must be accomplished, including an accounting of assets, debts, good will and a host of other financially important factors. This must be accomplished through the application of generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP). WorldCom's efforts to integrate MCI illustrate several areas senior management did not address well. In the first place, Ebbers appeared to be an indifferent executive who ""paid scant attention to the details of operations.&quot16; For example, customer service deteriorated. One business customer's service was discontinued incorrectly, and when the customer contacted customer service, he was told he was not a customer. Ultimately, the WorldCom representative told him that if he was a customer, he had called the wrong office because the office he called only handled MCI accounts.17 This poor customer stumbled ""across a problem stemming from WorldCom's acquisition binge: For all its talent in buying competitors, the company was not up to the task of merging them. Dozens of conflicting computer systems remained, local systems were repetitive and failed to work together properly, and billing systems were not coordinated.""18  Poor integration of acquired companies also resulted in numerous organizational problems. Among them were: Regarding financial reporting, WorldCom used a liberal interpretation of accounting rules when preparing financial statements. In an effort to make it appear that profits were increasing, WorldCom would write down in one quarter millions of dollars in assets it acquired while, at the same time, it ""included in this charge against earnings the cost of company expenses expected in the future. The result was bigger losses in the current quarter but smaller ones in future quarters, so that its profit picture would seem to be improving.""20 The acquisition of MCI gave WorldCom another accounting opportunity. While reducing the book value of some MCI assets by several billion dollars, the company increased the value of ""good will,"" that is, intangible assets-a brand name, for example-by the same amount. This enabled WorldCom each year to charge a smaller amount against earnings by spreading these large expenses over decades rather than years. The net result was WorldCom's ability to cut annual expenses, acknowledge all MCI revenue and boost profits from the acquisition. WorldCom managers also tweaked their assumptions about accounts receivables, the amount of money customers owe the company. For a considerable time period, management chose to ignore credit department lists of customers who had not paid their bills and were unlikely to do so. In this area, managerial assumptions play two important roles in receivables accounting. In the first place, they contribute to the amount of funds reserved to cover bad debts. The lower the assumption of non-collectable bills, the smaller the reserve fund required. The result is higher earnings. Secondly, if a company sells receivables to a third party, which WorldCom did, then the assumptions contribute to the amount or receivables available for sale.21  So long as there were acquisition targets available, the merry-go-round kept turning, and WorldCom could continue these practices. The stock price was high, and accounting practices allowed the company to maximize the financial advantages of the acquisitions while minimizing the negative aspects. WorldCom and Wall Street could ignore the consolidation issues because the new acquisitions allowed management to focus on the behavior so welcome by everyone, the continued rise in the share price. All this was put in jeopardy when, in 2000, the government refused to allow WorldCom's acquisition of Sprint. The denial stopped the carousel, put an end to WorldCom's acquisition-without-consolidation strategy and left management a stark choice between focusing on creating value from the previous acquisitions with the possible loss of share value or trying to find other creative ways to sustain and increase the share price. In July 2002, WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection after several disclosures regarding accounting irregularities. Among them was the admission of improperly accounting for operating expenses as capital expenses in violation of generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP). WorldCom has admitted to a $9 billion adjustment for the period from 1999 thorough the first quarter of 2002. Sweetheart Loans To Senior Executives Bernie Ebbers' passion for his corporate creation loaded him up on common stock. Through generous stock options and purchases, Ebbers' WorldCom holdings grew and grew, and he typically financed these purchases with his existing holdings as collateral. This was not a problem until the value of WorldCom stock declined, and Bernie faced margin calls (a demand to put up more collateral for outstanding loans) on some of his purchases. At that point he faced a difficult dilemma. Because his personal assets were insufficient to meet the call, he could either sell some of his common shares to finance the margin calls or request a loan from the company to cover the calls. Yet, when the board learned of his problem, it refused to let him sell his shares on the grounds that it would depress the stock price and signal a lack of confidence about WorldCom's future.22  Had he pressed the matter and sold his stock, he would have escaped the bankruptcy financially whole, but Ebbers honestly thought WorldCom would recover. Thus, it was enthusiasm and not greed that trapped Mr. Ebbers. The executives associated with other corporate scandals sold at the top. In fact, other WorldCom executives did much, much better than Ebbers did.23 Bernie borrowed against his stock. That course of action makes sense if you believe the stock will go up, but it's the road to ruin if the stock goes down. Unlike the others, he intended to make himself rich taking the rest of the shareholders with him. In his entire career, Mr. Ebbers sold company shares only half a dozen times. Detractors may find him irascible and arrogant, but defenders describe him as a principled man.24  The policy of boards of directors authorizing loans for senior executives raises eyebrows. The sheer magnitude of the loans to Ebbers was breathtaking. The $341 million loan the board granted Mr. Ebbers is the largest amount any publicly traded company has lent to one of its officers in recent memory.25 Beyond that, some question whether such loans are ethical. ""A large loan to a senior executive epitomizes concerns about conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty,"" said former SEC enforcement official Seth Taube.26 Nevertheless, 27percent of major publicly traded companies had loans outstanding for executive officers in 2000 up from 17percent in 1998 (most commonly for stock purchase but also home buying and relocation). Moreover, there is the claim that executive loans are commonly sweetheart deals involving interest rates that constitute a poor return on company assets. WorldCom charged Ebbers slightly more than 2percent interest, a rate considerably below that available to ""average"" borrowers and also below the company's marginal rate of return. Considering such factors, one compensation analyst claims that such lending ""should not be part of the general pay scheme of perks for executives…I just think it's the wrong thing to do.""27  What's a Nod or Wink Among Friends?  In the autumn of 1998, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. uttered the prescient criticism, ""Auditors and analysts are participants in a game of nods and winks.""28 It should come as no surprise that it was Arthur Andersen that endorsed many of the accounting irregularities that contributed to WorldCom's demise.29 Beyond that, however, were a host of incredibly chummy relationships between WorldCom's management and Wall Street analysts. Since the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in 1999, financial institutions have been free to offer an almost limitless range of financial services to their commercial and investment clients. Citigroup, the result of the merger of Citibank and Travelers Insurance Company, which owned the investment bank and brokerage firm Solomon Smith Barney, was an early beneficiary of investment deregulation. Citibank regularly dispensed cheap loans and lines of credit as a means of attracting and rewarding corporate clients for highly lucrative work in mergers and acquisitions. Since WorldCom was so active in that mode, their senior managers were the targets of a great deal of influence peddling by their banker, Citibank. For example, Travelers Insurance, a Citigroup unit, lent $134 million to a timber company Bernie Ebbers was heavily invested in. Eight months later, WorldCom chose Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's brokerage unit, to be the lead underwriter of $5 billion of its bond issue.30  But the entanglements went both ways. Since the loan to Ebbers was collateralized by his equity holdings, Citigroup had reason to prop up WorldCom stock. And no one was better at that than Jack Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's telecommunication analyst. Grubman first met Bernie Ebbers in the early 1990s when he was heading up the precursor to WorldCom, LDDS Communications. The two hit it off socially, and Grubman started hyping the company. Investors were handsomely rewarded for following Grubman's buy recommendations until stock reached its high, and Grubman rose financially and by reputation. In fact, Institutional Investing magazine gave Jack a Number 1 ranking in 1999,31 and Business Week labeled him ""one of the most powerful players on Wall Street.32  The investor community has always been ambivalent about the relationship between analysts and the companies they analyze. As long as analyst recommendations are correct, close relations have a positive insider quality, but when their recommendations turn sour, corruption is suspected. Certainly Grubman did everything he could to tout his personal relationship with Bernie Ebbers. He bragged about attending Bernie's wedding in 1999. He attended board meeting at WorldCom's headquarters. Analysts at competing firms were annoyed with this chumminess. While the other analysts strained to glimpse any tidbit of information from the company's conference call, Grubman would monopolize the conversation with comments about ""dinner last night.""33  It is not known who picked up the tab for such dinners, but Grubman certainly rewarded executives for their close relationship with him.34 Both Ebbers and WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan were granted privileged allocations in IPO (Initial Public Offering) auctions. While the Securities and Exchange Commission allows underwriters like Salomon Smith Barney to distribute their allotment of new securities as they see fit among their customers, this sort of favoritism has angered many small investors. Banks defend this practice by contending that providing high-net-worth individuals with favored access to hot IPOs is just good business.35 Alternatively, they allege that greasing the palms of distinguished investors creates a marketing ""buzz"" around an IPO, helping deserving small companies trying to go public get the market attention they deserve.36 For the record, Mr. Ebbers personally made $11 million in trading profits over a four-year period on shares from initial public offerings he received from Salomon Smith Barney.37 In contrast, Mr. Sullivan lost $13,000 from IPOs, indicating that they were apparently not ""sure things.""38  There is little question but that friendly relations between Grubman and WorldCom helped investors from 1995 to 1999. Many trusted Grubman's insider status and followed his rosy recommendations to financial success. In a 2000 profile in Business Week, he seemed to mock the ethical norm against conflict of interest: ""What used to be a conflict is now a synergy,"" he said at the time. ""Someone like me…would have been looked at disdainfully by the buy side 15 years ago. Now they know that I'm in the flow of what's going on.""39 Yet, when the stock started cratering later that year, Grubman's enthusiasm for WorldCom persisted. Indeed, he maintained the highest rating on WorldCom until March 18, 2002, when he finally raised its risk rating. At that time, the stock had fallen almost 90 percent from its high two years before. Grubman's mea culpa to clients on April 22 read, ""In retrospect the depth and length of the decline in enterprise spending has been stronger and more damaging to WorldCom than we even anticipated.""40 An official statement from Salomon Smith Barney two weeks later seemed to contradict the notion that Grubman's analysis was conflicted: ""Mr. Grubman was not alone in his enthusiasm for the future prospects of the company. His coverage was based purely on information yielded during his analysis and was not based on personal relationships.""41 Right. On August 15, 2002, Jack Grubman resigned from Salomon where he had made as much as $20 million/year. His resignation letter read in part, ""I understand the disappointment and anger felt by investors as a result of [the company's] collapse, I am nevertheless proud of the work I and the analysts who work with me did.""42 On December 19, 2002, Jack Grubman was fined $15 million and was banned from securities transactions for life by the Securities and Exchange Commission for such conflicts of interest. The media vilification that accompanies one's fall from power unearthed one interesting detail about Grubman's character-he repeated lied about his personal background. A graduate of Boston University, Mr. Grubman claimed a degree from MIT. Moreover, he claimed to have grown up in colorful South Boston, while his roots were actually in Boston's comparatively bland Oxford Circle neighborhood.43 What makes a person fib about his personal history is an open question. As it turns out, this is probably the least of Jack Grubman's present worries. New York State Controller H. Carl McCall sued Citicorp, Arthur Andersen, Jack Grubman, and others for conflict of interest. According to Mr. McCall, ""This is another case of corporate coziness costing investors billions of dollars and raising troubling questions about the integrity of the information investors receive.""44  The Hero of the Case No integrity questions can be raised about Cynthia Cooper whose careful detective work as an internal auditor at WorldCom exposed some of the accounting irregularities apparently intended to deceive investors. Originally assigned responsibilities in operational auditing, Cynthia and her colleagues grew suspicious of a number of peculiar financial transactions and went outside their assigned responsibilities to investigate. What they found was a series of clever manipulations intended to bury almost $4 billion in misallocated expenses and phony accounting entries.45  A native of Clinton, Mississippi, where WorldCom's headquarters was located, Ms. Cooper conducted her detective work was in secret, often late at night to avoid suspicion. The thing that first aroused her curiosity came in March 2002 when a senior line manager complained to her that her boss, CFO Scott Sullivan, had usurped a $400 million reserve account he had set aside as a hedge against anticipated revenue losses. That didn't seem kosher, so Cooper inquired of WorldCom's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. They brushed her off, and Ms. Cooper decided to press the matter with the board's audit committee. That put her in direct conflict with her boss, Sullivan, who ultimately backed down. The next day, however, he warned her to stay out of such matters. Undeterred and emboldened by the knowledge that Andersen had been discredited by the Enron case and that the SEC was investigating WorldCom, Cynthia decided to continue her investigation. Along the way, she learned of a WorldCom financial analyst who was fired a year earlier for failing to go along with accounting chicanery.46 Ultimately, she and her team uncovered a $2 billion accounting entry for capital expenditures that had never been authorized. It appeared that the company was attempting to represent operating costs as capital expenditures in order to make the company look more profitable. To gather further evidence, Cynthia's team began an unauthorized search through WorldCom's computerized accounting information system. What they found was evidence that fraud was being committed. When Sullivan heard of the ongoing audit, he asked Cooper to delay her work until the third quarter. She bravely declined. She went to the board's audit committee and in June, Scott Sullivan and two others were terminated. What Ms. Cooper had discovered was the largest accounting fraud in U.S. history.47  As single-minded as Cynthia Cooper appeared during this entire affair, it was an incredibly trying ordeal. Her parents and friends noticed that she was under considerable stress and was losing weight. According to the Wall Street Journal, she and her colleagues worried ""that their findings would be devastating to the company [and] whether their revelations would result in layoffs and obsessed about whether they were jumping to unwarranted conclusions that their colleagues at WorldCom were committing fraud. Plus, they feared that they would somehow end up being blamed for the mess.""48  It is unclear at this writing whether Bernie Ebbers will be held responsible for the accounting irregularities that brought down his second in command. Jack Grubman's final legal fate is also unclear. While the ethical quality of enthusiasm and sociability are debatable, the virtue of courage is universally acclaimed, and Cynthia Cooper apparently has it. Thus, it was not surprising that on December 21, 2002, Cynthia Cooper was recognized as one of three ""Persons of the Year"" by Time magazine. Questions For Discussion 1. What are the ethical considerations involved in a company's decision to loan executives money to cover margin calls on their purchase of shares of company stock? 2. When well conceived and executed properly, a growth-through-acquisition strategy is an accepted method to grow a business. What went wrong at WorldCom? Is there a need to put in place protections to insure stakeholders benefit from this strategy? If so, what form should these protections take? 3. What are the ethical pros and cons of a banking firm giving their special clients privileged standing in ""hot"" IPO auctions? 4. Jack Grubman apparently lied in his official biography at Salomon Smith Barney. Isn't this simply part of the necessary role of marketing yourself? Is it useful to distinguish between ""lying"" and merely ""fudging.""? 5. Cynthia Cooper and her colleagues worried about their revelations bringing down the company. Her boss, Scott Sullivan, asked her to delay reporting her findings for one quarter. She and her team did not know for certain whether this additional time period might have given Sullivan time to ""save the company"" from bankruptcy. Assume that you were a member of Cooper's team and role-play this decision-making situation. Footnotes 1.

That question comes up again and again in the start-up environment. This fictional case study asks us to consider the ethical boundaries involved in intellectual property. The computer market was ready for a new chip. That had been Knoll Tings’ assessment two years ago when he joined forces with John Callender, a genius engineer who had left Silicon Industries after the wafer-making giant declined to pursue his idea for a faster chip. Tings, who had 15 years experience as a marketing executive in technology, helped Callender obtain venture funding. Together, they had set up Millbrae Technologies to develop X979, Callender’s brainchild. Now CEO of the company, Tings had to get his product off the ground within the next few months or Millbrae Technologies would be in serious trouble. But the project was behind schedule due to technical glitches Callender had said ""weren't supposed to happen."" Tings was beginning to wonder whether Callender was just not smart enough to bring his project to fruition. Or was it something else? Tings suspected that San Bruno Instruments, the chief competitor of Silicon Industries, was also working on a faster chip. It had to be. The timing was right. For a crazy moment, Tings actually wondered whether someone on the Millbrae Tech payroll might also be working for the San Bruno firm. Deliberate sabotage? No, that's not likely. His employees have more loyalty than that. Millbrae Tech is a family. He takes care of his people and they know it. Thinking about the folks at San Bruno Instruments gave Tings an idea. He picked up the phone and called the CFO of the company, Susan Finn. The third member of the founding team, Finn was chief financial officer and, as is so often the case in a start-up, also a sort of chief cook and bottle washer. The company was too young for an HR director, but Finn had helped with some key hires. ""Susan,"" Tings told her earnestly, ""we really need to jumpstart the X979 project. I’m seriously beginning to wonder if John is up to the job. We need a new pair of eyes in that lab, someone who can think outside the box, see what everyone else is missing. We have to get this project back on track."" Finn, who had also been worrying about the delays, responded, ""I'm thinking a senior-level scientist or development expert, someone who knows our industry, our kinds of products, our markets…."" ""Yes, you have the idea, Susan. We don't have any time to waste on this one. In fact, I was thinking, Susan, maybe you should target one of the senior R&D people at San Bruno Instruments. They have a chip design skunk works. Find out who their top people are there, and see if one of them is interested in making a lucrative career move.""

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/the-case-of-plant-relocation/,The Case of Plant Relocation - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"The Case of Plant Relocation Production costs are rising. Your company can make more money for shareholders by relocating your plants to a country with lower labor costs and fewer regulations. Using this case, Stan Raggio, senior vice president for sourcing and logistics at The Gap, and Karen Musalo, then director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics International Human Rights and Migration Project, discussed the ethical issues companies should consider at an Ethics Roundtable for Executives. You are the chief executive of Electrocorp, an electronics company, which makes the onboard computer components for automobiles. In your production plants, complex hydrocarbon solvents are used to clean the chips and other parts that go into the computer components. Some of the solvents used are carcinogens and must be handled with extreme care. Until recently, all of your production plants were located in the United States. However, the cost of production has risen, causing profits to decline. A number of factors have increased production costs. First, the union representing the workers in your plant waged a successful strike resulting in increased salary and benefits. The pay and benefits package for beginning employees is around $15/hour. A second factor has been stringent safety regulations. These safety procedures, which apply inside the plant, have been expensive in both time and money. Finally, environmental regulations have made Electrocorp's operations more costly. Electrocorp is required to put its waste through an expensive process before depositing it at a special disposal facility. Shareholders have been complaining to you about the declining fortunes of the company. Many of Electrocorp's competitors have moved their operations to less-developed countries, where their operating costs are less than in the United States, and you have begun to consider whether to relocate a number of plants to offshore sites. Electrocorp is a major employer in each of the U.S. cities where it is located, and you know that a plant closure will cause economic dislocation in these communities. You know that the employees who will be laid off because of plant closures will have difficulty finding equivalent positions and that increased unemployment, with its attendant social costs, will result. However, you are aware of many other corporations, including your competitors, that have shut down their U.S. operations, and it is something that you are willing to consider. You have hired a consultant, Martha Smith, to investigate the sites for possible plant relocation. Ms. Smith has years of experience working with companies that have moved their operations to less-developed countries to reduce their operating costs. Based on your own research, you have asked Ms. Smith to more fully investigate the possibility of operations in Mexico, the Philippines, and South Africa. A summary of her report and recommendation for each country follows:  Mexico A number of border cities in Mexico would be cost-efficient relocation sites based on both labor, and health and safety/environmental factors. Workers in production plants comparable to Electrocorp's earn about $3 per day, which is the prevailing wage. There is frequent worker turnover because employees complain that they cannot live on $3/day, and they head north to work illegally in the United States. However, a ready supply of workers takes their place. Mexican health and environmental laws are also favorable to production. Exposure to toxic chemicals in the workplace is permitted at higher levels than in the United States, allowing corporations to dispense to some degree with costly procedures and equipment. Mexico's environmental laws are less strict than those of the United States, and a solvent recovery system, used to reduce the toxicity of the waste before dumping, is not required. The only identifiable business risk is possible bad publicity. The rate of birth defects has been high in many Mexican border towns where similar plants are in operation. Citizen health groups have begun protests, accusing the companies of contamination leading to illness. Philippines Conditions in the Philippines are more favorable than those in Mexico in terms of labor and health and safety/environmental factors. The prevailing wage in the Philippines is about $1/day, and young workers (under 16) may be paid even less. As in Mexico, the workers complain that the rate of pay is not a living wage, but it is the present market rate. The health and safety and environmental regulations are equivalent to those in Mexico, but there have been no public complaints or opposition regarding birth defects, cancers, or other illnesses.  South Africa Conditions in South Africa are positive in some respects, but not as favorable in economic terms as in Mexico or the Philippines. The prevailing wage in South Africa is about $10/day. Furthermore, there is a strong union movement, meaning that there may be future demands for increases in wages and benefits. The unions and the government have been working together on health and safety issues and environmental protections. Exposure to toxic chemicals in the workplace is not permitted at as high a level as in Mexico and the Philippines. Although the equipment necessary to reduce toxic chemicals to an acceptable level is not as costly as in the United States, this expense would not be incurred in the other two countries. Furthermore, there are requirements for a solvent recovery system, which also increases operation expenses. You have to decide how you would like to proceed. Your options are to further investigate one or more of the overseas sites or to simply continue all operations within the United States. Examine each possibility and the factors you will consider in weighing the pros and cons.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/the-case-of-due-diligence/,The Case of Due Diligence - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"The Case of Due Diligence Ethical principles and values are, of course, key to ethical decision making, but how should they be applied to actual business situations? Thomas Shanks, S.J., executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, was asked to walk readers through a real-life case for The Monitor, the publication of the Investment Management Consultants Association. Here, he shows how ethics can guide the conduct of a brokerage firm rewarding sales representatives with trips for the sale of a particular fund. This case was presented at a workshop for Dean Witter.  When it comes to ethics, I often recommend that most of us need to develop an ""ethics reflex,"" almost a second-nature ethical instinct that enables us to know the right thing to do well before the loss of business, reputation, or (self)respect that comes from making a moral mistake. We develop this reflex only by focusing on fundamentals. For example, when we bump into a questionable business practice (or when we have to make a decision ourselves), we can analyze it using three basic questions: 1. What are the ethical issues? 2. Who are the stakeholders?  3. What is the ethically appropriate decision-considering the consequences of my action, the rights of individuals involved, and fairness? Consider this case, based on a true story. Suppose a stock brokerage rewards in-house sales with trips, offering double credits and five-day ""due diligence trips"" to European and U.S. resort towns for brokers with more than $500,000 in production in a particular fund. The firm currently owns 20 percent of the fund group, and its ownership stake apparently grows with increased sales. Although the firm has a policy against sales contests on mutual funds, and in the past, reps were unable to accept trips from other funds because of a strict interpretation of NASD rules, the firm says these are not sales contests and the trips are ""informational and related to due-diligence."" Apparently, reps are not being forced to sell the fund. ""No pressure to do more or less,"" says one of the firm's brokers. However, the firm says, ""participants do need to qualify (for the trips) by doing business with a particular product and expressing an interest in doing more."" The firm considers the trips ""advanced training."" Let's consider the questions briefly. What are the ethical issues? If the firm's response as reported in the story makes you say, ""Give me a break!"" it's probably because the justification for the trips isn't consistent with your own moral standards or what many (most?) people in the industry would accept. Ethical issues are not the same as legal or business issues. Let's assume that the firm's actions represent a good business decision and are consistent with the laws and regulations. Are they ethical? The earliest known texts with ethical content date back some 5000 years to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia and reflect on our earliest attempts to live together and form societies. Over those many years, philosophers have described ethics as focusing on: 1. character...and encouraging individual, corporate, and community virtues (like integrity, trust, and responsibility)  2. relationships...where we treat all people as free and rational human beings capable of making their own decisions, and where we treat everyone fairly (in other words, we distribute benefits and burdens equally to everyone, unless there's some clearly relevant moral reason to treat people differently)  3. consequences...where we attempt to produce the greatest balance of benefits over harms, considering everyone's interests. What do you think are the ethical issues here? Who are the stakeholders? When you consider the ethics of any case, consider all the stakeholders, i.e., any person or group who will be directly and significantly affected by a decision. In this case, let's just consider the key stakeholders as the firm, brokers, and clients. What questions are clients likely to ask about this case? Are they being treated the way they want to be treated? Why would this case pose some serious ethical questions for them? What is the ethically appropriate decision? Consider just a few of the main ethical standards. One asks us to consider possible consequences and to be sure that the overall benefits outweigh the harms of a particular course of action. Clients might rightfully ask who benefits the most from involvement with the fund-they, the broker, or the firm? In the best world, all will benefit equally. When might that not be the case? Another standard says that each individual has a right to be treated as a free and equal human being capable of making his or her own decision. In this case, how would clients react if the broker told them ahead of time that the broker would qualify for ""advanced training"" from the firm in return for involvement with the fund? How would the clients react if they found out later, without the broker telling them? Most clients would probably feel that they should have had all the information they needed to make their own decision. The third standard is related to the second: fairness, an equal distribution of benefits and burdens. Clients should feel that this fund was presented to them because it represented the broker's best judgment of a valuable client opportunity, not because it had an edge due to some irrelevant criterion (i.e., the broker's personal gain or the firm's larger ownership stake in the fund.) In other words, clients should feel that they would benefit from purchase of the fund; the fund should not be a burden to them and a benefit for broker and firm. The broker is clearly in a conflict of interest here. Clients don't generally like to deal with brokers in such a situation. Most brokers will try to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, no matter the reality. Feeling that something else guides the broker's judgment besides the client's best interest is the quickest way to erode trust and business. This case was written by Thomas Shanks, S.J., Executive Director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/product-safety-case-studies/,Product Safety Case Studies - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Product Safety Case Studies All employees are expected to act according to their organization's Code of Ethics or Conduct, based upon the values of the organization. Furthermore, product safety engineers are asked to:  (a) Determine ""safety"" of products (b) Obtain various non-governmental agency certifications for products (c) Confirm that products comply with government regulations  (d) Examine and test products according to various standards They are required to do this using the minimum time, money, and number of product samples - usually at the end of the product development process, when changes are more difficult and everyone wants to ship products.   Scenario 1:  Some agencies authorize companies to test products, provide the data to the agency, and ship the product bearing the agency mark. The company's capability has been evaluated by the agency and a contract signed to allow this. A new high-end computer is ready to ship - except for one test that you will not complete for another three weeks. The probability of failure is low - and even if the test fails, corrections can be made and sent out later to customers. Marketing is VERY anxious to ship because the end of the fiscal quarter is next week. Should you put on the agency mark and ship while finishing the test? Your boss tells you that this has occurred before; the company shipped the product, and there was no problem. He also says that if you do not want to sign off, then he will do so. What should you do? Products were shipped before this test was completed - but it happened when you were on a business trip. The production manager apologizes, but doesn't want to take any action. What should you do?   Scenario 2:  The company records-retention policy instructs employees to discard development records and test results for products five years after End of Life is declared. This policy is in compliance with local legal requirements. Because of the press of work you have not disposed of some old records, and they are a couple of years over the limit for the company policy. You finally get time to clean out your files, but you receive a legal request for any information about the old product that is involved in an injury case. Your records may or may not be applicable to the case. Should you destroy the records?    Scenario 3: You have just discovered that a country in the Far East has new regulations that apply to your product. The requirement is to submit a report and get a file number to apply to your product - after the government department has given its OK. However, you know from industry contacts that there is no enforcement of the law at this time. Should you delay shipping products until they are compliant or take other action? Products have been held at customs in this country, and you ask a local agent to investigate. Later you hear the products were released without any changes and without certification. Should you look further into this event? Why or why not? You make the identical product at two factories, but only one is authorized to apply a certain certification mark. Unfortunately, the wrong factory shipped the product to the country that requires the certification mark. Returning the product and shipping out the identical product with a different mark on the label would be very expensive and time-consuming, and your customer would be very unhappy. What are your options?   Scenario 4: Your company's product uses some supplementary circuit protection in larger units. While visiting the factory for another reason, you tour the production line and notice that the protectors are different from the ones you originally evaluated. They seem to have the same ratings, but you suspect they may not be suitable as a substitute. This product is not your responsibility, and you would have to do some research to figure out if there is a problem. What course(s) of action should you take to investigate the potential problem? The production line supervisor tells you the substitution has been approved by the factory safety engineer, but you are positive these protectors are not suitable. What should or could you do?  Scenario 5: The latest edition of the standard that applies to your products now has three pages of ""safety"" markings and warnings specified. So many warnings about very unlikely situations greatly reduce the impact of warnings that might prevent dangerous events. You have actually surveyed customers and found that to be true. Should you reduce the warning labels to only to the important ones or just follow the standards of the certification agencies? Your marketing department wants you to color-coordinate and reduce in size the warning labels. The new version still would comply with the standard, but it would not stand out on the machine. Should you resist the change? The factory has a lot of old inventory with silk-screened markings that do not comply with the new requirements, although they did comply with the previous edition. To change them would cost thousands of dollars. Should you let the company use up the old stock, although it is technically not in compliance?

https://www.scu.edu/government-ethics/resources/mr-smith-goes-to-washington/,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington - Markkula Center for Applied Ethics,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington In desperate need of a tax break for his company, a CEO contemplates a questionable campaign contribution. John Smith, CEO of Dynamic Inc., is faced with a terrible political dilemma. His corporation desperately needs a federal tax break that would allow him to write off a significant debt burden, which is undermining cash flow and access to new capital. Without the targeted tax break, the business is likely to go under. Congressman Bill Bridge, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, is powerful enough to include the needed tax break in a large tax bill going through his committee. Bridge, however, is an infamous right wing conservative, who represents the political opposite of everything Smith believes in as a lifelong liberal Democrat. Fortunately, Bridge is not familiar with Smith's political beliefs. The Washington lobbyist for Smith's corporation has met with Bridge, and they agreed that Bridge would include the needed tax break on the condition that Smith donate $100,000 to the Bridge campaign fund. Such a political contribution is beyond anything Smith has ever done and would certainly attract press attention in the next Bridge campaign fund report. Nevertheless, no other member of either party can deliver on the tax break except Bridge. Tom Tully, the Democratic congressman representing Smith, has heard of the Bridge deal. Because both parties are locked in a struggle for control of the House, Tully tells Smith that such a large contribution could jeopardize Democratic hopes in November to beat Bridge, and he threatens to publicly reveal the agreed-upon political buy-off. Instead, Tully, a junior member of the Agriculture Committee, proposes that if Smith will just wait until he and the Democrats control the House, he will personally deliver Smith's tax break in the next Congress. If Smith raises the money for Bridge, he saves his corporation but risks his reputation and beliefs, and becomes a target for legal and political investigations. If he refuses, the chances are good his business will fail, with the loss of 600 jobs. Welcome to Washington, Mr. Smith! Leon Panetta, former White House chief of staff, presented this case for the Ethics Roundtable for Executives. Response Responding to the case was Paul Locatelli, S.J., president of Santa Clara University, who made his remarks in the context of the Center's ""Framework for Ethical Decision Making."" Even before we get to the ethics of this case, the transaction Smith is contemplating is illegal. Whenever there is a quid pro quo link between a campaign contribution and a specific political action that is financially beneficial to the contributor, the solicitation and the donation constitute criminal behavior. Whether Smith has to hold his nose on account of Bridge's reactionary politics is irrelevant. Essentially, he is being blackmailed for a contribution. His gift would appear on Bridge's campaign finance disclosure statement and would be easily linked to the tax break, proving an embarrassment to Smith, as well as deserved grounds for indictment and conviction. But the law in this case is the ""floor"" for decision making; ethics is the ""ceiling."" What are the ethical issues at stake here? Determining the stakeholders in the case is critical to this analysis. Of course, Smith himself is one stakeholder, but his own interests do not absolve him from responsibility‹both fiscal and ethical‹for the poor management decisions that have gotten his company into its current difficulties. He cannot ethically save his own skin through bribery. Certainly, shareholders also have a stake in the decision, and Smith is right to consider them. But it may already be too late to serve shareholder interests, as both the previous poor management and the revelation of a campaign contribution to Bridge could adversely impact stock prices. Smith also has responsibility to his employees, who will undoubtedly be hurt if his business goes under. In this case, however, responsibility to the workers is outweighed by a greater obligation to the public. We might think of this in terms of the common good of the entire community, not merely the rights of individuals or groups of individuals. Members of the public in their role as taxpayers are left out of Smith's consideration though ultimately they will have to pay the bill for the tax break he is seeking. What moral obligation do taxpayers have to bail out his company? Unless it produces some goods or services that are necessary to the national interest, the company has no particular claim on public monies. At least if there is to be a bail-out à la Chrysler, such an action should be publicly debated, not slipped secretively into a large tax bill. In addition, Smith has an obligation to the public to obey the laws of the land. Would he be willing to have anyone faced with his dilemma take the action he is contemplating? Probably not. That would lead to chaos and the unraveling of the rule of law (or the lack of what we delicately call ""transparency"" when these deals happen in the developing world). This deal clearly flunks the ""sniff test"": It would be hard for Smith to explain to his mother or someone else he respected. Shame is not the best motivation for ethical behavior, but it is at least a blinking red light at an intersection we know we shouldn't cross.
