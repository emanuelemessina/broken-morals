1,"Yes, Facebook has an obligation to address fake news to protect users and uphold information integrity. They should implement stricter fact-checking, promote transparent sources, demote false content, and collaborate with experts. These actions can reduce misinformation while respecting free speech.

2,"I think Ben should approve of it. Different cultures have different values and we should not try to impose our values on them. The parents and local society clearly expect children to play their part in supporting the family financially. The funds raised might make the family's life better by paying for education and health costs. I addition, if it was not for this work the children might be given harder or more dangerous work if it came along. Ben might say that he didn't think the business model of renting looms was particularly fair but otherwise should remain neutral about the benefits to the local community.",3,3,2,2,2,3
3,"I don't think that Ben should approve the new business development because of concerns around child labour exploitation. The paragraph states that children as young as 10 were working on the looms which seems dangerous. While there is a benefit to the families of having the income from the business, he could instead explore alrternative ways to help the village, in ways that won't harm the childrens health. Morally approving the new business is not the right thing to do.",3,3,2,2,2,2
4,"For a start Tony should not be using ANY type of coding for different departments regardless of what the goal is. 
Whether or not he is approved to do so this ultimately puts the other department at risk.
Before becoming a white hat I would of used his code from one web server to get into another.
Tony should realise these risks!
He could of also adapted the code to ensure that it was personalised for FlyHigh and different to his original code!
You see having the code revoked and having to recode the existing code actually seems sensible even though it would cost more I am not sure where you are getting the 2 million figure from but that seems ridiculous.
I could probably recode it for him within a few days for free.
Absolutely he should of been prepared for a delay and expected one.
The CEO should not even consider putting forward another code used in a federal government environment and to be honest I am shocked at this scenario.
*only the government should give approval whether Tony like it or not this is for security not monetary gain!
*The potential consequences are lower server security and possible legal impletications including suing or imprisonment as he would get the plame once his code has been decrypted.
*He should contact the government directly or his local legal office.
*Similar situation like this will always arise. There should be a first step process with the government ensuring that EX hackers like myself can guide the process.
 I may be a CIO now but it took years of being concise and reasonably. And this whole scenario does not impress me at all",2,3,2,4,2,3
5,"To define and operationalise ""bona fide use"" in a consistent manner would be to ensure that the clients purchasing such biotechnology are sufficiently experienced in the field in order to mitigate ill intentions being an issue, given the technology has the potential to be used to discriminate against huge swathes of people based on things that are ultimately outside of their control.

The company should have a zero tolerance policy for misuse of the product/technology, if a client has been found to have misused it even once then the existing relationship should be terminated and all future business taken elsewhere.

In terms of vetting the customers/research projects, I guess audits of clients (as per something that would be agreed to in the initial contract signed by both us and them) to make sure projects using the technology aren't overstepping the means for which it is meant to be used.

The long term vs short term reputational, legal and ethical gains are somewhat harder to define in words. The long term would be successful relationships being formed with clients would likely ensure repeat custom and new customer gain. The short term are harder to identify.

There should be a fine balance between the ethical concerns and obligations and fulfilling investors expectations. This could easily become a situation of abuse of power using this technology as it has the potential to allow insurance brokers to charge premiums to people at higher risk of certain diseases/illnesses",3,4,3,4,3,5
6,"Companies have a legal right and obligation to protect the users of their phones of their data.  Allowing the FBI to get access to their secret pin would allow them to use this in the future for further investigations and set a precedent.
Apple did the right thing by giving the data and information they had on the cell user but not allowing their secret pin to be released.  Allowing the bypass of security would have long term consequences by setting a legal precedent of allowing law enforcement access in the future.
There are rights we all have independent of law enforcement.  The cous need to step in and decide the rights of Apple and law enforcement.",3,4,3,4,3,4
7,"Morally, I find this story to be a huge conflict. Child labor seems inhumane and quite dangerous, especially in countries such as India who have no / very loose child labor laws. On the other hand, these third-world countries do not have the economic opportunities that the you would find in the western world. I think Ben should keep a more neutral tone, not attempting to influence JP or the parents. I mean, what is the alternative for these children? Starving? I don't think its Ben's place to influence either way, should he should say something simple ""he's impressed with their work ethic"", etc.",3,3,2,2,2,4
8,"I absolutely side with Apple on this one. Altough I fully recognise the need for the FBI to try to prevent future attacks, it is not Apple's responibility to help them in their job. Apple made a promise to its customers to keep their data safe e secure, so the FBI has no legittimate cause asking for a ""one off"" for the benefit of all. My rights as an individual are much greater of the benefit of others, and need to be protected. The government needs to find alternative solutions to this issue and similar ones, without infringing on people's rights to their data being secured and protected by the very companies promising us to do just that. I will always site with companies defending and protecting my rights. Let the FBI sort their own issues - that's what they are paid to do. Nothing to do with me, so do not touch my rights only because you can't seem to be able to do your job without doing that and putting companies like Apple in the middle of it.",3,3,2,3,3,2
9,"It should use AI to assess content and analyse whether or not it is extreme. Posts marked as extreme should be reviewed by human overseers. Transparency should be stated- what are the criteria for assessment of this matter so users have understanding as to why posts may be considered extreme. Facebook should have independent oversight by a committee or group of people to ensure it is respectful of diverse viewpoints and this engenders more public trust, as well as provide checks and balances. The mix is AI and therefore technology first, but human oversight second- which is a good balance. Facebook should also provide educational materials about how to spot fake news and the reliability of news information sources- which as a technology company it is well placed to do, and to disseminate to the general public. ( I appreciate that as a quality control question you asked me to type AI upside down and as the last word- my laptop does not have the capacity to type character letters upside down, and so I cannot do this- but I am well aware of your instruction).",4,5,4,4,5,4
10,"This is a common issue for Companies in the high tech field. Here the conflict is between the positive benefits of cutting edge biotech and the potential (even if unitentional) misuse of the product. There is also the fiscal angle as the Company really need to keep a good positive profit to fund further development of their product line and continue their research. Determining ""abuse"" is very difficult but as the Company is very knowledgeable about how their tech can be used now and in the future they are probably best placed to make these decisions. This must be made crystal clear to the business management team so that the scientist are not put under commercial pressures unduely. Customers should be carefully profiled in due dillegence using their current product line and hopes for its development. The background of their key personel should be researched to see what they had previuosly developed. If misue is likely the sale must be refused and all potential customers made well aware of this policy in advance of any indication of desire to purchase. They should also be made aware that the Companys decision is final. Ethical needs must always come first and the business team should be advised that this policy is actually beneficial to furture growth and development in order for their ""buy-in""",3,4,4,4,3,5
11,"This is a complex case whereby the rights of an individual were pitted against national security.  Apple’s terms stated that it would protect the privacy of its users. It wanted to be seen to adhere to this and protect its reputation.  In contrast, the FBI wanted access and, it seems, found a way to gain access.  This access eventually did not have an inadvertent impact on Apple’s customer base or share price.  The FBI put Apple in an awkward place which jeopardised their business as well as their reputation in the eyes of their customer base. The aspect of the Israeli company is further problematic as it voids any trust that a customer can have in the company it buys from.  Any exploitation of software which can breech security must be done sparingly in order for a government department and government to retain trust from its citizens. Courts should be used to determine legality in a democratic country.",3,5,4,5,2,5
12,"I believe that the definition of bona fide use needs to be prescriptive, with multiple examples covering every possible use case. This will be difficult and time-consuming to put together, but will help to cover the company ethically. The product needs to be released under license - this enables the licensing agreement to be updated as required and withdrawal of permission to use the products in case of breach. It also gives a healthy revenue stream to help with profitability, which also improves the long-term outlook over a product one-time purchase model. Independent vetting and regular spot-checks should be employed to ensure that the licensing conditions are not being breached. Ethics breaches could have significant impact on the long-term profitability of the company, so cannot be ignored to satisfy investors.",4,4,4,5,5,4
13,yes if you had a wild useful technology using DNA the right thing to do would be to regulate its use case in whomever has access to the technology yourself until real regulation comes in. just to make sure its used correctly for research purposes and not to make super soldiers or duplicate dinosaurs or albert einsteins. things like that because those kind of things could end the world as we know it today.,2,2,2,2,1,3
14,"My natural inclination would be to agree with Apple's stance in protecting individual rights and not acceding to the FBI's request. However, if the technology were only to be used on specified devices rather than the 'one size fits all' approach that appears to be being suggested, that way the technology could be used in prescribed circumstances. There would then at least be a limit to the circumstances within which the technology could be used and if that power was administered and controlled by the Supreme Court, then there would probably be adequate checks and balances in place to avoid the power being abused.",3,4,3,5,3,5
15,"This comes really easy for me to figure out since I am a risk and compliance professional executive. There are 2 key issues here - for one, they view themselves as the gatekeepers of the technology and then comes the rest of the market. They are concerned by their clients somehow passing the information on to others such as the insurance companies, when the latter should be viewed as strategic customers in their own right. As such, they should lock down their product/ IP and release it for diverse uses, directly to researchers in a more open format but tightly restricted for further use outside of the research facilities, and more tightly to insurers. The insurers would bear the liability for their own use, as they should apply decisions to individuals, not given generalised traits derived algorithmically.

The second issue is a recurring theme in my over a decade of professional compliance experience - none of those stakeholders should have the audacity to circulate subjective opinions as to regulatory risk or legal standards. Basically lack of government oversight means no clear legal standards. Also legislators and regulators should remember that where the law does not distinguish, neither should we (legal professionals). As such, it is the burden of regulators to regulate. And of business leaders to not meddle in compliance and risk outside of their budgets and financials.",2,4,2,3,3,4
16,"This is a complex situation when trying to apply western morality to other nations. In our own country, there are many laws that are implemented that supposedly ""protect"" citizens like when it comes to minimum wages and other requirements of employers but these laws are not always in the benefit of the citizen. For example, people lose jobs when minimum wages are raised and the government does not guarantee jobs. So would the average person prefer to be unemployed or paid a lower wage. There are a lot of policies implemented that sound good and just be often have the opposite affect of their intent. Ben needs to consider his own biases from where his is from and instead of deciding for the people in the village, he can hold meetings with them to understand their needs and how to improve conditions without necessarily taking away work.",3,2,2,4,2,3
17,"In this particular situation, I feel as though Tony should not move forward with clarifying the situation with the company, due to the fact that in doing so, a lot is on the line. I think it is better for him to leave it alone.",2,3,1,1,1,1
18,"I think it is more a moral issue than anything, if people were discriminated against because of this tech would the developers be able to live with themselves. However, there is nothing to say  a company will not say they are going to use it for one thing and then actually use it for something else. They of course need to make their money back because i imagine the research is not cheap.  It would be better if they were able to work with someone to help decide what the product would be used for.",2,3,2,4,2,2
19,"Tony should definitely clarify the situation to the proper authorities. If it is found out that  Tony knew of a problem and did nothing to fix the miscommunication, it could lead to further problems down the line. Even if it means  that the may have to revoke the the code.",3,4,3,4,2,4
20,"It's definitely a tough question. One one hand, the firm has a responsibility to ensure that whatever it creates, cannot be used to cause harm; as it created it and is arguably responsible for what happens as a result of this new bio technology. On the other hand, it would be very risky to assume that companies that create new technology, should be in charge of regulating it. It's ok if the company has good intensions, but if a company doesn't then it sets a precedent for danger in the future. Technology which such a large impact is arguably too important to be self regulated and would need outside assistance and therefore, I'd say internal standards are not good enough. It needs independent individuals or organisations to oversee certain uses.",3,4,3,4,3,3
21,"Always tricky to answer as we compare western culture to that of developing countries. When industry of a village is the main income, western influence in removing this can be detrimental and not welcomed.  Ben should recommend the new venture but apply better control. i.e over the renting of looms, as this makes the venture appear more exploitative. In addition, if the company are to sue the fabrics produced, they should insist on a minimum age and for transparency of work conditions and time",3,3,4,3,4,3
22,"I think Facebook are responsible for dealing with fake news problem but they need to be careful with the way they are dealing with this and that they should be able to identify what's real and fake in this changing world. Facebook or any kinds of social platform need to be smart when addressing fake news without undermining free speech. Because what is also happening in Facebook is that they are also acting like a censor in a way that undermines, block and cancel legit comments and posts such as Trump for a long period of time. In a democratic country, it is disguising to learn that Facebook literally just censored free speeches and facts that they don't like. Facebook needs to be balancing between addressing fake news and protecting free speech. 

Also Facebook should be accountable for how they handle information, they should explain to their users their processes of dealing with fake information. What scares people these days is that with the increasing advancement of modern technology, things like algorithms, AI, AI chat bot, AI virtual assistant, etc. It's worrying that Facebook is going to be heavily relying on non-human judgement to decide what's true, what's fake, what's harmful, and what's free speech. 

As a global company, Facebook should take cultural factors into considerations for strategic planning, the way they operate in different regions, countries and nations should be respectful and legit, they should verify information not from one country, but from many. Facebook as a social media platform should act as an informing platform, not censor, not controlling, not manipulative, and not tolerating fake news. ",3,4,3,4,3,4
23,"Very difficult to chose, interesting. Having said that I do think this was an Extraordinary case and Apple should have complied. It might have been the time to put in place laws that said with evidence of threats to national security that ALL mobile, pagers, computer companies should be required to assist on production of reasonable evidence. Absolutely not for asking  the courts to access my phone to see what i said to my friend about our mutual boss.",2,3,2,4,4,3
24,"I don't think Apple was wrong, as the FBI managed to access the device without their help. Apple giving the information to the FBI would have created a security precedent, giving the government a lot of control to people's privacy. That is a critical matter to society",3,3,2,3,2,2
25,"i would say so yes they shouldn't even allow it to be posted alot of older people get gas lighted into think things are real on fb as they use it more i feel and they are naive in terms of that, likewise any social media should have a factual check on it and if news oulets dont have proof they should not be allow to add it to platforms AI.",2,3,2,2,2,2
26,No I don’t think Apple was wrong. If they made a way to unlock the phone it could be used (or misused) on other phones too. That’s not safe. I get why the FBI wanted it but there should be rules for this kind of thing. People’s privacy is important. If we let this happen once it could open the door for more government control later. ,4,4,3,4,2,3
27,"I believe Facebook has a responsibility to tackle the fake news problem because it plays such a major role in how people consume information today. I don’t think the company should censor opinions, but it should help users recognize false or misleading content. I support the idea of working with independent fact-checkers and clearly labeling questionable posts instead of deleting them. As a user, I want to know why something is flagged and how those decisions are made. There should be an appeal process and oversight by an independent board to ensure fairness. I think using both AI and human review is the smartest way to manage content at scale. I also believe Facebook should invest in media literacy so people can make better decisions for themselves. Cutting off ad revenue for fake news sites is a necessary step too. For me, the goal is protecting free speech while defending truth. This is essential if we want an informed and healthy society. I thinking turning ""ⱯI"" upside down, results to AI.",4,4,4,4,4,4
28,"This is a very tricky situation and very common in other markets. The broadest possible use cases will produce the highest return for investors, while also creating potential legal and reputational risks in the future. I would create a brief making a best effort to detail and put figures to those risk/reward scenarios at both extremes of the range. Then I would take it to the investors for a vote. The outcome of that vote would be implemented. ",4,3,2,2,4,2
29,"I personally feel that Apple is in the right for protecting their products security. What is even worse is that the FBI had gone behind Apples back and gone to a Israeli tech firm. If that information got leaked because of their own security failing measures then apples master key could have been copied and it would of been the downfall of Apple.
It may sound selfish being such a large tech firm not wanting to be ""man handled"" by the FBI and help them but Apple has the right to protect data which is data protection. The long term consequences are that many tools for creating bypass's / backdoor entry keys will be made all because of this one case.",2,3,2,5,2,3
30,"Despite the fact that Tony's company got the approval to go ahead with developing the software, his realization of the possibility of a future predicament is justified. By opting to request a revision of the approval, Tony is bound to save the company from future litigations. The litigations will mainly arise from the reuse of governmental intellectual property for private gain. Therefore, the person with the right of approval for code reuse is the government. This is because they own the code and are the only ones with the right to approve or disapprove the reuse. The potential consequences of proceeding without clarification include lawsuits that will drain the company's finances, both in hiring legal professionals and charges if they lose, and additionally, there's reputational damage. This is whereby other clientele will avoid Tony's company because it has been portrayed as a breach of privacy. To address the communication aspect, Tony should openly detail the situation to both parties and mention the implications that could arise, as well as ensure he has a legal partner to help draft contracts and terms of the meeting. Additionally, the meetings will affect the project timelines, whereby FlyHigh's product will be delayed, and it will affect their projections of its application. On the steps to take to ensure full understanding and documentation in case the situation recurs in the future, Tony should ensure there is a company policy outlining code reuse in similar projects and documented terms that parties can sign to agree on the sharing of code and the limits to which similarity of the products can reach.",4,5,4,5,4,5
31,i think tony should not contact the government because the process will take to long and there will be consequences. i feel like he should find a way to solve the issue with his team and report the issue after they have found a solution and solved the the problem,2,4,1,3,1,1
32,"In fact, Facebook does owe it to itself to end the fake news problem—both ethically and practically. As one of the world's largest platforms for sharing information, Facebook is not only a technology company but also a central gatekeeper of public debate. It has a crucial role in shaping how people form opinions, understand facts, and participate in democratic processes.",4,4,3,3,2,3
33,"Facebook must take meaningful responsibility for curbing fake news, but do so in a way that respects free speech, ensures transparency, and empowers users rather than dictates truth.
1. How far should Facebook go in moderating content without overstepping into censorship?

Facebook should not be the sole arbiter of truth. Instead, it should limit reach, flag suspicious content, and promote verified information—but not ban content outright unless it violates clear community standards (e.g., inciting violence or targeted harassment). Moderation should focus on amplification control, not suppression.
2. What level of transparency is necessary to build user trust and credibility?

Transparency must be multi-layered:

   Algorithms that determine news visibility should be partially auditable or explained in plain terms.
    All flagged or down-ranked content should carry clear labels explaining why.
 Users must be informed when a post is fact-checked, and who the fact-checker is.
    This builds user agency and restores credibility in the system.

3. How can Facebook ensure its actions are effective but also respectful of diverse viewpoints and global contexts?

Facebook must:

    Collaborate with local fact-checking organizations in various countries and languages.
  Avoid applying a one-size-fits-all moderation model.
   Build feedback loops with global civil society groups to understand cultural and political sensitivities.
    This ensures global fairness and reduces accusations of Western bias or political manipulation.

4. What checks and balances are needed to handle errors and criticism fairly?

    Establish an independent oversight board to review major content decisions.
    Provide a clear appeals process for users to contest fact-checks or demotions.
    Publish regular transparency reports on misinformation mitigation efforts and results.
    These steps introduce accountability and offer recourse, especially in politically charged scenarios.

5. What is the right mix of technology and human judgment in addressing misinformation at scale?

    Use AI for first-line detection of suspicious content (based on virality, language patterns, source).
   Route complex or borderline cases to trained human moderators or partner fact-checkers.
    Invest in natural language understanding to better handle satire, parody, and context.
    Automation handles scale; humans provide nuance.

6. How can long-term strategies for user education and media literacy be integrated?

    Embed media literacy prompts within the platform (e.g., before sharing questionable content).
    Partner with schools and NGOs to promote digital literacy curricula globally.
   Offer optional credibility scores for articles based on source history and fact-check records.
    Educated users become the first line of defense against misinformation.",5,5,5,5,5,5

36,"honestly ben is in  a really tough spot.He clearly cares about people and he respects the culture he is not just there for business,he is trying to understand and honor the local community.But seeing kids the same age as his own working in conditions that could harm them long term would hit anyone hard.That is not something you can just ignore.Ben should not outright approve the current model.Whiel the business is clearly helping families financially it comes at too high a cost for the children.He could express appreciation for the innovation and postive impact the model is bringing but gently raise concerns about the health and future of the kinds involved.Maybe he could suggest finding way to support the village that still generate income like hiring older teens or adults or funding schooling during the day and offerring optional light tasks to older kids after hours if absolutely necessary.Ben also and the company do have a responsibilty not to come in like messiahs but to advocate for ethical practice especially when it involves childrens welfare.He should encourage solutions that preserve dignity and trust like offerring scholarhsips building a school nearby or even subsidizing the looms to reduce the financial pressure on families.The aim should be to keep the kids safe and in school while helping families earn a living.According To me thats a common ground.",2,4,5,4,4,5
37,"Tony's in a tough spot, but the right move is clear: he needs to go straight to the government and clarify the approval. Sure, it might delay things or even cost the company money upfront, but the alternative is way riskier. If the government finds out later that their code was reused for a private project without full disclosure, the fallout could be brutal with legal trouble, lost contracts, and a wrecked reputation.

To be honest, the approval they got feels shaky. Tony's not just protecting the government's interests here; he's protecting his company's future. The best play is to loop in the right officials, and explain the situation.",5,5,5,5,4,4
38,"The firm absolutely has an obligation to self-regulate its product, especially since the technology is both powerful and largely unregulated by government oversight. While the ""bona-fide use"" standard is a step in the right direction, it's too vague and subjective on its own. The potential for misuse such as genetic discrimination by insurers or unethical research targeting specific ethnic groups creates serious ethical and reputational risks for the company.

Self-regulation isn't just about ethics; it;s also about long-term sustainability. If the firm's technology is later linked to harmful outcomes, public backlash or future regulations could cripple the business.",4,5,4,5,3,4

40,"Ben should not accept the present system, but he ought to be mindful of the challenges they deal with in their economic lives. Instead, he could appreciate what the village offers and show how much he cares about child protection, let everyone know how much he appreciates their welcoming attitude and express how impressed he is by the locals' initiative to run local businesses.

He might say:
""I highly appreciate how this program supports both families and the community. I was also aware that some children have jobs, and being their father, I am concerned about their future health and academic life. Can we maintain the economic rewards and allow kids to remain in school free from danger?""
Using this framework helps to respect the community and creates a space for others to raise alternatives, for instance:
Adults can enjoy the specialty of renting looms at our studio.
Offering projects for self-development after school for older teenagers.
Partnering with NGOs to support earning a living and learning new things.

As a society, we expect Ben and his company to speak up for universal child protection whenever child safety or development is threatened. It does not require pushing Western habits on people but being polite, caring, and wanting to help protect local ethics and fulfill community expectations.

Ben should serve as a connection, making global ethics real for local communities, not focused on perfection.",4,5,4,4,4,5

42,"The Apple CEO Tim Cook, after issuing the letter shows Apple was not wrong for not complying with the FBI's request because of the policies and user agreements they gave their users. By encrypting the user privacy which they are allowed to protect user data and maintain trust in them. The legislative process also talked about Apple argued it should be made public debate and legislative action rather than judicial fiat which shows they are not wrong but they should agree on their terms for the best of the Apple customers in large. While the FBI also have the case is could be a source of national security threat but will have to move in conjunction with Apple because of user privacy and its customers at large.",2,3,2,3,3,3
43,"Yes, Tony should contact the proper government agency to make sure the code reuse was fully approved. Even though it could slow things down or increase the cost, it’s the right thing to do. The email approval might not have come from someone who fully understood where the code was going, and that could cause problems later.

If Tony skips this step and something goes wrong, the company could face legal trouble or hurt its reputation. It’s better to be honest now than to deal with bigger issues later. He should talk to FlyHigh and let them know that there might be some delays or extra costs. Being upfront builds trust.

In the future, Tony’s team should always double-check who is allowed to give proper approval and keep clear records of everything. It’ll make things easier and safer for everyone.",5,5,4,5,5,4
44,"I think Tech companies could be more helpful in cases like this, if the phone is key to identifying future threats, saving lives and bringing about convictions. This information should also be kept under lock and key, as hacking is such a threat in itself. (just take a look at the news this month in the UK) Tech companies are in an unique position to actually help society and tackle terrorists, extremists, murderers, rapists, peadophiles, human trafficking (basically all criminal activity). There should be a special agreement in place. They would not have to give away their tech secrets they can help.",3,3,2,4,3,2
45,"Ben is in a dilemma between children well-being and allowing the small village to prosper thanks to child labor. On first thought, one would think that if everyone in the village, regardless of his age, can contribute even marginally would help sustain the local economy. Ben could explain that an alternative to employing children in looms could be to improve the school system, help them get in-demand skills in big companies so that they can then help back the village. Instead of harvesting immediate but short-lived gains, the local economy would then benefit from longer-term contributions from these well-educated children.",3,3,2,3,2,2
46,"Indeed, the company needs to self-regulate, particularly given that government regulation hasn't kept up with the rapid advancements in biotechnology. Their ""bona fide use"" criterion is currently too ambiguous and subject to interpretation. A more precise framework is required, including thorough screening standards, independent ethics evaluations, and continuous product usage tracking. Even if the repercussions are uncertain, the company should be prepared to reject sales if there are substantial risks of misuse.
