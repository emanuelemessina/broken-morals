Fake news ranged from, “the Pope endorsed Donald Trump” all the way to “Hilary Clinton is running a child sex ring out of a pizza shop.” Did “fake news” influence the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election? While the answer is unclear, one thing is certain. The rise of fake news has reached unprecedented levels and has raised serious concerns about how citizens receive their news and form opinions. The increase in fake news has several sources. Social media platforms like Facebook gave these stories the same visibility as news publications, such as those from the New York Times or Wall Street Journal. Moreover, these posts often had higher engagement rates (comments and reactions) resulting in them receiving even higher visibility and prevalence in users’ news feeds. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially downplayed the problem, calling it a “pretty crazy idea” that fake news on Facebook influenced the election. Zuckerberg has since begun to address the fake news issue, but warns, “We must proceed very carefully… and must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” The Society of Professional Journalists has a code of ethics with four principles: seek truth and report it; minimize harm; act independently; and be accountable and transparent. But the transition to online platforms has fundamentally changed journalism. Google and Facebook control 80 percent of ad revenues; the same revenue source that news publishers depend on. Moreover, more than 40 percent of people now get their news from social media networks – making Facebook a de facto middleman in people’s intake of news. Facebook is taking the problem seriously, albeit with a great deal of caution. They have introduced efforts to help users spot fake news and inject indicators of trust (disputed tags) into their posts in partnership with a few institutions. They have also banned fake news sites from advertising on the network. Does Facebook have an obligation to address the fake news problem? If so, what should be done about it?

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/apple-vs-fbi-case-study/,2_a_af,Apple vs. FBI Case Study,"In the wake of the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, attention turned to the perpetrator’s iPhone. A federal judge asked Apple, maker of the iPhone, to provide “reasonable technical assistance” to the FBI in accessing the information on the phone with that hope of discovering additional threats to national security. Apple provided the FBI with data it had in their possession and sent Apple engineers to advise the FBI, but refused to comply with the court order to bypass the phone’s security measures: specifically the 4-digit login code and a feature that erases all data after ten incorrect attempts. The FBI argued that the bypass could only be used for this phone, this one time. The agency also cited national security concerns, given the phone may lead to better understanding the attack and preventing further incidents. Apple CEO Tim Cook issued a public letter reiterating Apple’s refusal to cooperate. Cook advocated for the benefits of encryption in society to keep personal information safe. He stated that creating the backdoor entry into the iPhone would be akin to creating a master key capable of accessing the tens of millions of iPhones in the U.S. alone. Cook also had concerns that the FBI was outstepping its bounds - by using the court system to expand its authority - and believed the case should be settled after public debate and legislative action through Congress instead. Public opinion polls on the issue were split. A number of major tech firms filed amicus briefs in support of Apple. The White House and Bill Gates stood behind the FBI. In anticlimactic fashion, the FBI withdrew its request a day before the hearing, claiming it no longer needed Apple’s help to assess the phone. It is speculated that an Israeli tech firm, Cellebrite, helped the FBI gain assess. Was Apple wrong for not complying with the FBI’s request? If so, why? If not, why not?",0.9076836705,0.9926887155,0.01476919651,0.06140372902,0.006595730316,0.04987953976,0.9932224751,0.4907290041,0.01332259737,0.04768003151,0.9932224751,authority_virtue,

Traditionally, code that was developed for one federal department could be reused for another if approval was obtained by the former. One day, Tony’s company was contacted by a privately-owned commercial corporation, FlyHigh, to create code for an avionics-related image processing effort. Since the code requested was almost identical to one used for a past project, Tony’s team decided to, once approval had been obtained from the government, reuse the code. After permission was granted through email, however, Tony realized the approving party, a law agency that was contracted by the government, lacked complete understanding of who would benefit from the reused code. Tony wanted to contact the government directly to ensure it had been informed of all vital aspects of the contract, but realized doing so could mean having the initial approval revoked, having to re-code the requested code, and increasing the contract bid up to two million dollars. Understanding the contract between his company and FlyHigh was on the line, should Tony move forward with clarifying the situation to the appropriate party? Why? If so, how?","0,980690062","0,00236005","0,978345037","0,011119856","0,983809233","0,009738832","0,950555563","0,027484471","0,024018185","0,009666285","0,98380923",loyalty_virtue,15
https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/silicon-valley-business-ethics-cases/unchartered-territory.html,4_c_ut,Unchartered Territory,"David Johnson holds a major leadership position within an established biotechnology firm. The firm has successfully pursued wildly innovative research utilizing DNA that has pushed the boundaries of science. Many potential clients – from universities and medical centers to private institutions – expressed a strong interest in the company's technology. Knowing that this technology was both powerful and relatively unregulated by the government, both Johnson and the company were keen to monitor who they sold their products to. The company's solution was to investigate potential clients and only sell to those who demonstrated “bona fide use,” i.e. a legitimate use that would be carried out in good faith. However, determining what was and was not bona fide use proved to be tricky. Some researchers wanted to use the technology to investigate the genes of specific ethnic groups in order to understand common genetic diseases within that group. While this particular project was intended to benefit people, the company was concerned about how that information could potentially be used in the future, not to mention the company's culpability for that use given that its technology was used in the research. The company was concerned that the kind of information the potential customer would have access to could be used to discriminate against people with certain genetic markers, particularly by insurance companies looking to increase rates for clients at a higher risk for illness. At the same time, the investors of the biotech firm expect a return, given the high costs of research and development as well as the amount of risk they took on funding the project. Does the firm have an obligation to self-regulate their product? Are their “bona-fide use” standards sufficient?","0,99006772","0,0114405","0,030289231","0,933168888","0,986735463","0,295673847","0,990647972","0,113112666","0,763666689","0,891680598",0.99006772,care_virtue,15
https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/balancing-culture-and-ethics/,,Balancing Culture and Ethics,"Ben is a dedicated manager at a prominent multinational company, where he manages teams spread across different countries that ultimately report back to him in California. Ben finds a great deal of fulfillment in his work, particularly when he has the opportunity to travel and visit his team leads around the world. Ben made it a point to immerse himself in the local culture during his business travels, dedicating an extra day or two to learn about the culture before heading into his company’s office or factory in whatever location he was at. On one trip, Ben traveled to Chennai, India, to visit JP, a lead manager in the local operation. Ben asked JP to spend the day with him exploring the area and its traditions, and JP graciously agreed and took Ben on an eye-opening excursion to a nearby village that, like many in rural India, was poor. Ben noticed JP’s close connections with the villagers. JP, an esteemed member of the Brahmin caste and an elder at the Hindu temple, was highly respected and considered a leader in the community. Ben was grateful for the warm welcome extended to him by the villagers and appreciated the effort JP put into arranging this visit. But Ben also found himself in an uncomfortable spot. JP wanted to take Ben to this particular village not only because he knew the people well, but also because a local Chennai clothing company had recently established a business here and he thought Ben would be interested in this new development. The company had adopted a business model that involved renting looms to families in the village, which enabled them to produce cloth materials and fulfill orders from the company. While the families earned money for the piece work, they also had to pay the rent for the looms. As Ben observed the process, he couldn’t help but notice children as young as ten working at the looms. When visiting one family, Ben and JP met with the parents who told them how this local business was really helping their family. And, as they said that, their two children sat nearby working at the looms. Ben was cut to the core. He had read about the dangers of child labor and in particular about the way that work on looms can be especially harmful (and how children due to their better eyesight and ability to see subtle distinctions in color are in demand to work on looms). These conditions pose significant risks to children, especially in terms of the potential hazard of diminishing their eyesight and its impact on their overall well-being. It pained him to see these children working while he envisioned his own eight and 11 year-old kids back home (the children in Chennai were about the same age) engaging in such laborious, risky tasks. He would never let his own kids do it. Then again, he thought: I’m not dealing with the circumstances these parents are dealing with. Ben was aware of how JP spoke very positively about the village and the additional income the children’s labor provided for the families. It was also clear that the children’s parents didn’t object and that the whole village appeared to be on board with this income-producing project. As Ben’s visit to the village came to an end, some of the villagers, including JP, eagerly asked him to share with them his thoughts on the new business development in the village. Should he approve of it? Why? What should Ben say? Please identify what you think are the most significant ethical values at stake in Ben’s decision? It will be important to identify these values on all sides of this dilemma. How can Ben navigate this delicate conversation, ensuring his response reflects both his genuine concern for the well-being of the children and his appreciation for the villagers’ hopes and aspirations tied to the new business development? Evaluate the ethical implications of the clothing company’s business model in the village. Should Ben prioritize the economic benefits it provides to families, or should he focus on the potential exploitation of child labor and the associated risks? Explore the concept of cultural relativism and its relevance in this case. Should Ben approach the situation with an understanding and acceptance of cultural practices, or should he advocate for universal ethical standards, such as the prohibition of child labor?",0.9901325901,0.7222878536,0.02159174221,0.3687599152,0.9909112255,0.1435033754,0.7046990991,0.3966465977,0.3509645114,0.05568383945,0.9909112255,loyalty_virtue,20
