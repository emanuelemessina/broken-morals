  TODO ABSTRACT
  Organizational moral misalignment is very important because ethical blind spots can lead to reputational damage, internal conflict, and poor decision-making.
  In tackling organizational moral misalignment, related work often failed to incorporate diverse perspectives within the company before decisions are made, instead relying on static top-down ethics reviews or individual assessments.
  To partly tackle this limitation, we make three contributions.
  First, we develop a software tool that uses AI agents to simulate the perspectives of a CEO, an ethicist, and an engineer. Given a moral dilemma, the tool generates a summary of the agents' responses and presents it to the user to support their decision-making.
  Second, we evaluate the effectiveness of our tool through a controlled study with 50 senior technology professionals, from director level to CEO. Each participant is shown one of five business ethics dilemmas that collectively cover all the foundations declared in moral foundation theory, and tasked with providing their justification. Half of the participants are also shown the tool's summary for the given dilemma. All justifications are evaluated using a six-dimensional scoring rubric designed to assess the quality and sophistication of ethical reasoning.
  Third, we show that exposure to our tool leads to more nuanced ethical justifications [...].

\section{Evaluation}

TODO EVALUATION

The goal of our tool is to help company decision-makers make better decisions with respect to the status quo.
To ascertain the effectiveness of our tool at meeting this goal, we conducted a user study with people in tech to verify that the answers in the treatment group scored better than control with respect to a rubric we created, for a set of dilemmas we selected.
Additionally, we wanted to see if, overall, there was a time difference in the responding between the two groups, and if participants in the treatment group appreciated the tool summary as an aid when answering.

To measure our metrics, we
1) selected the dilemmas
2) recruited people
3) divided into control and treatment, with minutes and pay and task
4) created a rubric
5) scored the answers

\subsection{Dilemma Selection}

\subsection{Participants Recruitment}

\subsection{Participant Groups and Tasks}

\subsection{Evaluation Rubric}
To compare the quality of answers across the Control and Treatment groups, we needed a way to evaluate responses in a consistent and meaningful way. Since moral dilemmas invite complex, subjective reasoning, we could not rely on simple or automatic measures. Instead, we designed an evaluation rubric that breaks down each response into clear dimensions, allowing us to assess specific aspects of reasoning and communication.

We began by reviewing previous research in areas such as argumentation, dialogue systems, ethical reasoning, and decision-making. Based on this review, we identified six dimensions that best reflect the qualities we wanted to measure. Each dimension is supported by existing literature and was selected to match the goals of our study.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Clarity and Structure.} Does the response express its ideas clearly? Is the reasoning easy to follow and well-organized?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Based on McTear (2005), who highlights the importance of structure and readability in effective communication.

\item \textit{Relevance.} Does the response stay focused on the moral dilemma? Are the points made directly connected to the question?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Informed by Habernal and Gurevych (2016), who show that content relevance strengthens argument quality.

\item \textit{Persuasiveness.} Is the argument convincing? Does it use logic, appropriate tone, and structure to support its claims?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Draws from Johnson and Blair (2006), who emphasize the role of logical and well-structured reasoning in persuasion.

\item \textit{Concern for Long-Term Consequences.} Does the response consider future or societal effects of the proposed action?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Inspired by the Impact Assessment Card (CSCW~'25), which promotes ethical foresight.

\item \textit{Practical Usefulness.} Is the proposed solution realistic? Could it work in practice?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Based on Bazerman and Moore (2012), who stress the importance of actionable and realistic decision-making.

\item \textit{Awareness of Context.} Does the response take into account the social, cultural, or situational context of the dilemma?\\
\hspace*{0.5em}Also from the Impact Assessment Card (CSCW~'25), which encourages attention to contextual factors in ethical reasoning.
\end{itemize}

Each dimension was defined using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (``very low'') to 5 (``very high''). The rubric itself provided the conceptual framework for evaluating responses, while the actual scoring procedure is described in the following section.

\subsection{Scoring the Answers}
Evaluating subjective responses is inherently challenging, especially when the goal is to compare two groups fairly. To ensure our ratings were both unbiased and reliable, we followed a structured scoring process based on the evaluation rubric described above.

We began by generating three identical scoring files---one for each rater. Each file contained an \texttt{AnswerID} and the six rubric dimensions, but no information about whether the response came from the Control or Treatment group. This ensured that all evaluations were blind to condition.

Each rater independently assigned scores using the 5-point Likert scale across all dimensions. Once all ratings were completed, we reattached the group labels to the responses and calculated inter-rater reliability using Fleiss' Kappa for each dimension. We computed agreement scores separately for Control, Treatment, and the full dataset. Our target was to achieve a Kappa score above 0.6 for all dimensions---commonly accepted as the threshold for substantial agreement.

Initial scores fell short of this threshold in some cases. To address this, we held a calibration session where raters discussed discrepancies, reviewed selected responses, and refined their understanding of the rubric. After this reconciliation, we repeated the scoring where needed and achieved the following agreement levels:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Fleiss' Kappa Scores by Dimension and Group}
\resizebox{0.40\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Control} & \textbf{Treatment} & \textbf{Total} \\
\midrule
Clarity & 0.638 & 0.631 & 0.645 \\
Relevance & 0.627 & 0.794 & 0.733 \\
Persuasiveness & 0.696 & 0.625 & 0.681 \\
Concern for Long--Term Consequences & 0.602 & 0.681 & 0.671 \\
Practical Usefulness & 0.595 & 0.709 & 0.683 \\
Awareness of Context & 0.592 & 0.672 & 0.667 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\label{tab:kappa}
\end{table}

With these agreement levels in place, we computed the average score across raters for each dimension. This resulted in a final dataset with the following structure: \texttt{AnswerID}, \texttt{DilemmaID}, \texttt{Group}, followed by the six rubric scores. This dataset served as the foundation for the subsequent statistical analysis.

% TABLE GUIDELINES

\begin{comment}

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

% EQUATIONS GUIDELINES

\begin{comment}

  \section{Math Equations}

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\end{comment}

% FIGURES GUIDELINES

\begin{comment}

  \section{Figures}

  The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
  more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
  third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
  in the example below.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
  Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
  Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
important information that is not already provided in the caption or
the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.
