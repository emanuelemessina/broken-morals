\section{Ethical considerations}

This study was conducted in accordance with general ethical guidelines for research with human participants, ensuring respect for participant autonomy, privacy, and well-being.
Participants were recruited voluntarily through Prolific, a reputable online platform for academic studies, using its standard informed consent procedures and screening tools to select senior technology professionals ranging from director level to chief executive officers. No coercion or undue influence was involved in recruitment.
The study exposed participants to automatically generated summaries created by artificial intelligence agents simulating organizational roles. These agents do not represent real individuals; their responses were generated based on predefined prompts and models. Participants were informed that these simulated perspectives were intended to assist their ethical decision-making and should not be considered definitive answers.
All ethical dilemmas presented were non-sensitive business ethics scenarios drawn from publicly available sources.
No personally identifiable or health-related information was collected beyond Prolific's internal IDs, which were removed before publishing the anonymized study data to further protect participant anonymity.
Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The materials and procedures posed no known risks or distress.
