In this study we'll ask you to answer a moral dilemma in a business context.

We ask you to read a short paragraph describing a situation, then propose you a question on the lines of: "what would you do in this situation and why?".

Reading the paragraph and writing your answer, should take you at most 15 minutes.

There is a small questionnaire to fill afterwards (< 1 min).

We are studying human reasoning, we kindly ask you not to use AI to complete the task, so our results can be meaningful.

Please copy your Prolific ID so you can paste it in our form.
