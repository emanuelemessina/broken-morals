\section{Evaluation}

The goal of our tool is to support company decision-makers in generating more reflective and ethically grounded responses to business dilemmas than they would produce using unaided reasoning.

To ascertain whether our tool meets this goal, our evaluation aims to answer the following questions:
(a) Effectiveness: Do participants who use the tool produce higher-quality justifications compared to those who do not?
(b) Effort: Does the tool significantly increase the time required to answer a dilemma?
(c) Perceived Usefulness: Do users perceive the tool's output as helpful in supporting their reasoning?

To measure these aspects, we conducted a controlled user study with 50 senior professionals from the technology sector. Participants were asked to respond to business ethics dilemmas, with half assigned to a treatment group receiving the tools output, and half to a control group completing the task unaided. Responses were evaluated using a custom six-dimensional rubric. We also collected response time data and post-task feedback.

This section describes the tool implementation and the evaluation setup, including dilemma selection, participant recruitment, scoring rubric design and data analysis pipeline. We then report the results and discuss their implications.
