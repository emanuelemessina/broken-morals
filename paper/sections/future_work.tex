\section{Future Work}

Despite the promising results, several limitations warrant consideration.
This study is limited by its small sample size and the artificial nature of short-form dilemma responses. While the participants were well-qualified, the controlled setting differs from real-world decision-making environments, where stakes, time pressure, and accountability may differ significantly. Additionally, while the selected dilemmas span all five moral foundations, each participant only encountered one scenario, limiting within-subject comparison.

Future work should explore longitudinal and in-situ use of the tool, measure long-term effects on ethical reasoning habits, and test alternative agent configurations (e.g., varying roles, adversarial interactions). Expanding to cross-cultural settings may also reveal how role norms and moral framing vary across organizations and societies.
