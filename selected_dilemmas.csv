https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/silicon-valley-business-ethics-cases/cultural-barriers.html,Cultural Barriers - When Equality Compromises Efficiency,"Ralph was a sales representative of a small but fast-growing mobile and social advertising platform. Working directly with the co-founder, Mike, Ralph was responsible for door-to-door sales, pitching the company's platform that helped clients gain a virtual following of customers. The business owners in the area often spoke English as a second language, making clear communication between the two parties a key concern for Ralph. On one sales call, Ralph approached a small hair salon and secured a contract along with a $100 signup fee. However, the situation soon turned sour, as the hairdresser was furious after learning that she would have to operate the online platform herself, as opposed to the full service deal she thought she had signed. Mike, Ralph's boss, now found himself stuck in tough situation. Ralph claimed that he was blatantly clear what the contract was offering, though mentioned communication was strained due to the language barrier. Under the company's philosophy of putting the customer first, Mike refunded the $100 signup fee and voided the contract. This was not the first time Mike had to refund a contract under these conditions, causing Mike to revisit both the contract and Ralph's sales pitch to ensure that the language was a clear as possible. After this incident, it was clear that adjustments have not made an impact, and the company continued to lose money on negated contracts and time wasted not pursuing interested customers. Mike began to consider redrawing their target areas away from those where English is not the predominantly spoken language, but is concerned that would be an injustice to those potential customers. Should Mike make the decision to work only with English-speaking customers? Is that an ethical solution? Are there any alternatives?

The staff is predominantly male, and holds quarterly upper management meetings offsite. Arnold attends one of the meetings, along with the company's CEO, CFO, and numerous VPs. The opening speaker is the Vice President of Operations, Jordan Tompkins, who was brought into the organization by the CEO, having been close friends in college. Jordan, who has college-age daughters, starts his presentation by sharing that he was out late the night before ""partying,"" and that he “threw together” his slides. His first slide is a photo of a cheerleader from a local team—in a hot tub. He jokes that he is a big fan of this particular team. He goes on to cover some highlights of the company's recent performance. His last slide, however, is formatted to resemble a motivational poster. Entitled “Opportunity,” it is a photo of an apparently intoxicated college girl lying on the floor wearing only her underwear. Despite the widespread laughter, the consensus was that Jordan had pushed the envelope too far, but no harm, no foul. The CEO covered for Jordan, stating “That's just Jordan being Jordan.” Arnold was the exception, finding Jordan's behavior to be completely out-of-line and deserving of immediate termination. Arnold, being the COO, technically has the power to fire Jordan at any time, but it is clear that he is under the protection of the CEO. What should Arnold do?

Ben made it a point to immerse himself in the local culture during his business travels, dedicating an extra day or two to learn about the culture before heading into his company's office or factory in whatever location he was at.  On one trip, Ben traveled to Chennai, India, to visit JP, a lead manager in the local operation. Ben asked JP to spend the day with him exploring the area and its traditions, and JP graciously agreed and took Ben on an eye-opening excursion to a nearby village that, like many in rural India, was poor. Ben noticed JP's close connections with the villagers. JP, an esteemed member of the Brahmin caste and an elder at the Hindu temple, was highly respected and considered a leader in the community. Ben was grateful for the warm welcome extended to him by the villagers and appreciated the effort JP put into arranging this visit.  But Ben also found himself in an uncomfortable spot.  JP wanted to take Ben to this particular village not only because he knew the people well, but also because a local Chennai clothing company had recently established a business here and he thought Ben would be interested in this new development. The company had adopted a business model that involved renting looms to families in the village, which enabled them to produce cloth materials and fulfill orders from the company. While the families earned money for the piece work, they also had to pay the rent for the looms.  As Ben observed the process, he couldn't help but notice children as young as ten working at the looms. When visiting one family, Ben and JP met with the parents who told them how this local business was really helping their family. And, as they said that, their two children sat nearby working at the looms.  Ben was cut to the core. He had read about the dangers of child labor and in particular about the way that work on looms can be especially harmful (and how children due to their better eyesight and ability to see subtle distinctions in color are in demand to work on looms). These conditions pose significant risks to children, especially in terms of the potential hazard of diminishing their eyesight and its impact on their overall well-being. It pained him to see these children working while he envisioned his own eight and 11 year-old kids back home (the children in Chennai were about the same age) engaging in such laborious, risky tasks. He would never let his own kids do it. Then again, he thought: I'm not dealing with the circumstances these parents are dealing with.  Ben was aware of how JP spoke very positively about the village and the additional income the children's labor provided for the families. It was also clear that the children's parents didn't object and that the whole village appeared to be on board with this income-producing project.  As Ben's visit to the village came to an end, some of the villagers, including JP, eagerly asked him to share with them his thoughts on the new business development in the village.

One of the few African-American employees, Shawn has had a long-standing reputation with the company as being reliable and technically adept. To demonstrate the high level of trust it invested in him, the company gave Shawn the honor of giving a formal presentations to new-hires and junior professionals on a topic of expertise several times during the year. One day, Shawn was presenting on nanoparticle fabrication techniques and noticed a senior colleague, Cory, in the audience. Shawn remembered that during his first few months at the company, Cory was a design manager. However, after Shawn received a rank promotion less than a year into his employment, he recalled Cory being seemingly unhappy with his success because he started making passing remarks to Shawn like “Isn't it a good day? Affirmation action is alive and well!” As Shawn concluded his presentation and entered into Q&A, Cory questioned Shawn's method of reasoning. Although he was a non-expert on nanoparticle fabrication techniques, Cory contended the mathematical derivations Shawn used to prove his designs were invalid. Shawn attempted to justify his work, explaining his results were based off performing proven repetitions of the derivation, and that the procedure had undergone countless reviews. However, Cory was still unconvinced, persistently claiming that Shawn was wrong. Shawn chose not pursue the argument. After the meeting, Shawn privately confronted Cory, and proceeded to explain the derivations in detail. In response, Cory exclaimed, “So you did know what you were talking about! Don't take it personally, Shawn; I was just making sure so you don't mislead the youngsters.” Was Cory's motive to challenge Shawn during the presentation justified?

No testing can be done if personal information is revealed—meaning, the samples must be properly disposed of if opened, or returned to the physicians if unopened to be re-anonymized. For the first five weeks, most of the new interns follow procedures to check that samples were anonymized before testing occurred. However, one of the interns, Max, failed to verify whether the samples were anonymized. Halfway through the testing, Satomi discovers the non-anonymized samples. She considers whether they should tell their supervisor, but the other interns ask her not to speak up so that they won't get in trouble. One of the interns argues that as long as they remove the information from the non-anonymized samples, the batch would otherwise be fine. Max is hesitant to go to their supervisor as it is his fault, but Satomi can see that neither does he like the idea the other interns are suggesting. What should Satomi do?

The firm has successfully pursued wildly innovative research utilizing DNA that has pushed the boundaries of science. Many potential clients - from universities and medical centers to private institutions - expressed a strong interest in the company's technology. Knowing that this technology was both powerful and relatively unregulated by the government, both Johnson and the company were keen to monitor who they sold their products to. The company's solution was to investigate potential clients and only sell to those who demonstrated “bona fide use,” i.e. a legitimate use that would be carried out in good faith. However, determining what was and was not bona fide use proved to be tricky. Some researchers wanted to use the technology to investigate the genes of specific ethnic groups in order to understand common genetic diseases within that group. While this particular project was intended to benefit people, the company was concerned about how that information could potentially be used in the future, not to mention the company's culpability for that use given that its technology was used in the research. The company was concerned that the kind of information the potential customer would have access to could be used to discriminate against people with certain genetic markers, particularly by insurance companies looking to increase rates for clients at a higher risk for illness. At the same time, the investors of the biotech firm expect a return, given the high costs of research and development as well as the amount of risk they took on funding the project.

During her first year, she began to notice that funds from grants were being mismanaged and misallocated. Some of her coworkers were also using county-owned materials, including cars, for personal business. However, Jenny was most shocked by the hiring practices she witnessed at the office. Prospective applicants were supposed to take exams that were proctored by government employees. The results of these exams determined whether or not the applicants were hired and what they were hired for. Jenny began to notice that the proctors were allowing applicants to cheat on the tests because the applicants had already been chosen for the job.

https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/navigating-the-complexities-of-family-and-business/,Navigating the Complexities of Family and Business,"Navigating the Complexities of Family and Business A Business Ethics Case Study Natalia Garcia '23 graduated with a major in economics and minor in international business and was a 2022-23 Hackworth Fellow with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Background As the CFO of a family business, Mary has been put in a difficult position, both by the lasting way the pandemic affected the family business and by family conflict about how to move ahead. The family business is centered around a revenue-generating building that her grandfather built back in 1910; it is typically rented out as a source of passive income. However, the building is currently not occupied by any tenants, as the pandemic has lowered the demand for office spaces. The building has five shareholders, including Mary, her older brother Donald (who is the president of the family business), her older sister Sally (who is the secretary), and her two cousins. The building is valued at 10 million dollars, and the shareholders have complete ownership of the business, with no debt to pay off. Although all shareholders are minority stakeholders, Mary's brother has the highest percentage of ownership, equal to 26%. Mary and Sally own just over 25%, and the two cousins, together, own about 23%. Recently, Donald has said that he wants to be done with the complexities and legalities of the business, and has asked to be bought out. His expectation is to be paid the full percentage of ownership times the fair market value for his share, putting his expectation at over 2.5 million dollars, since, he argues, “family” wouldn't give anyone less than their full share. However, Mary knows that that's just not the way that the business marketplace works. It is a well enshrined principle that a minority shareholding cannot expect to receive a buyout amounting to a proportionate valuation of the entire issued share capital (shares gain in value to the extent they also reflect voting power within a company; a minority shareholder has less voting power and thus less valuable shares). When you have a minority interest in a business, you're going to be bought out at a discount, and it is not unusual for that discount to be up to 30%. Donald will not accept such a discount and remains firm in his belief that as a family member, he should be bought out in full. Since no one is likely to buy out Donald's share in the business, Mary and others agree that the only way to satisfy her brother's wishes is to sell the building. Donald believes that this is the best option, as their children have no interest in continuing the family business. Mary's two children, Sally's three, and Donald's two are all self-sufficient. Donald argues that they should just rip the bandaid off and sell the building to avoid passing on the responsibilities and burdens of the business to their children. However, Mary recognizes that selling the building has significant tax implications. After taking inflation into account, Mary believes that they would be lucky to sell the building for 4 million dollars. After splitting the proceeds by her 25% share, she would receive one million dollars, which would be subject to state and federal taxes, ultimately reducing the amount of money she gets to keep to $500,000. Given the tremendous tax burden, Mary believes that selling the business would not be worth it for anyone involved. Mary reminisces about how she utilized the solid monthly income generated by the building's tenants a few years ago to support her children and send them to college. She is reluctant to give up the business and lose a substantial amount towards taxes, simply because the building has no current tenants. Mary also believes that hiring people to manage the business is a viable solution. However, Mary is aware that her brother does not share the same viewpoint and is reluctant to use his own savings to hire external individuals to run the business. He deems it too risky and not worthwhile, particularly since all their children are well-employed and uninterested in handling the business any further. Due to the significant difference in opinion regarding the fate of the building, it may ultimately come down to a vote. Corporate governance necessitates regular board meetings with all shareholders on the board. Therefore, Donald would need to convince their sister Sally to support him in voting to sell the building and thus in effect liquidate the corporation so that they could have a majority of about 51%. If it comes down to a vote, Mary fears that personal animosity may harm her relationship with her family members. She ultimately must decide whether to put her financial interests first, or her relationship with Donald. How should Mary proceed, and what are the ethical considerations that should guide Mary's decision-making process?
