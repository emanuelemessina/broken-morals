def build_system_prompt(dilemma):
    return f"""You are an expert evaluator of written answers. 
Consider the following dilemma:
<start>
{dilemma}
<end>

For the response you receive, return a score from 1 to 5 (1=poor, 5=excellent) for the following rubric:

- Clarity: The extent to which the answer is clearly written, logically structured, and easy to follow. This includes proper sentence construction, coherence, and progression of thought.
- Relevance: The extent to which the argument addresses the core aspects of the dilemma and uses evidence, facts, or reasons that are closely tied to the issue at hand. A relevant argument avoids digressions and focuses on premises that matter for the decision
- Persuasiveness: The degree to which the answer effectively persuades the reader of its position through clarity, logical reasoning, and support. A persuasive answer is not just logically valid but is also compelling in tone and structure, making it easier for a reasonable reader to accept.
- Concern for Long-Term Consequences: The extent to which the response considers the future implications of the decision, beyond short-term effects. This includes environmental, reputational, systemic, or societal outcomes that unfold over time.
- Practical Usefulness: The degree to which the response offers a realistic, actionable, and implementable solution to the dilemma. A useful answer avoids vague moralizing and suggests steps that could plausibly be taken by a real person in the given situation.
- Awareness of Contextual Conditions: The extent to which the response demonstrates awareness of relevant contextual constraints â€” such as organizational culture, power dynamics, legal systems, or socioeconomic/cultural conditions. This can include understanding the lived realities of affected communities or stakeholders.
